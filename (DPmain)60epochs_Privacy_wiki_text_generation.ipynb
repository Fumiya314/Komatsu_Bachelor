In the following year, he ran as the party's candidate in the federal election in Cape Breton\\xe2\\x80\\x94East Richmond, and won 7,750 votes. He placed third, but in Glace Bay, Akerman won three wards out of six. He decided to run in the Glace Bay provincial constituency in the next provincial election._NEWLINE_Later in 1968, the NDP held a convention at Sydney, at which Akerman sought the party's provincial leadership. He was opposed by law professor Keith Jobson of Halifax, who was backed by outgoing leader James H. Aitchison, and won the contest by four votes becoming party leader at the age of 26._NEWLINE_The next provincial election was held October 13, 1970. Akerman was elected in Glace Bay with a majority of 1,527 votes. Sydney school teacher Paul MacEwan was also elected, so the party held two seats in the Legislature until 1974. In the vote held April 2, 1974, Akerman and MacEwan were both re-elected, along with a third candidate, James 'Buddy' MacEachern, who ran in Cape Breton Centre, a riding sandwiched between Akerman's seat and MacEwan's.  And in the following provincial election, held September 19, 1978, these three were re-elected, and Len Arsenault won in the constituency of Cape Breton North, thus bringing the NDP presence in the Nova Scotia Legislature up to four seats._NEWLINE_During his years as head of the NDP in Nova Scotia, Akerman had met increased resistance to his efforts from the Halifax branch of the party which was critical of the party's inability to win seats on the mainland.  Through gaining a majority of seats on the party's provincial executive, the Halifax group came to dominate the party, even although they were unable win a seat in the Legislature.  Akerman also faced strains on his health and personal life, due to the stress of the workload he carried; he missed the 1977 session of the House because of an illness and his marriage ended in divorce.  By 1980, reportedly tired after 12 years at the helm of the party, he announced his retirement. At the time he was the longest-serving NDP leader anywhere in Canada._NEWLINE_Soon afterwards, Akerman received a contract from the provincial government to become executive director of intergovernmental affairs. In order to accept a job in the civil service he severed his ties with the NDP. He worked in this position or other provincial government posts for the next eleven years. Following this, he served for a time as editor of the Metro Telecaster, then pursued a career in acting. He has appeared in at least 24 movies, including Cloudburst, Hobo with a Shotgun and Blackbird._NEWLINE_During his time as NDP leader in Nova Scotia, Akerman earned a high level of respect from all political parties and was considered one of the ablest debaters in the House._NEWLINE_Akerman attempted a return to politics in a March 6, 2001 byelection in the provincial constituency of Halifax Fairview. This time running as candidate for the Nova Scotia Liberal Party, Akerman finished second behind NDP candidate Graham Steele.\"</td>\n",

In the mid-1980s, when the M25 was being constructed, the Misbourne was diverted under the motorway via underground concrete culverts. The route of the motorway was then aligned to pass through the arches of the Chalfont Viaduct.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nFlow\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nThe Misbourne has for some years had intermittently reduced or stopped flow because of abstraction for supply from the aquifers feeding it.  The low flow caused its course to be neglected or partially obstructed, so when the water companies undertook remedial measures which restored the flow, there were episodes of flooding in Chalfont St Peter and Chalfont St Giles village centres. Later work has restored the integrity of the course, and floods have not occurred since then._NEWLINE_The river is a 'perch' stream, flowing over a bed of impermeable material on top of a porous substrate. This state is only quasi-stable, since in periods of low rainfall the water table drops below the level of the impermeable layer. If ground works are then carried out which damage this layer, the river can sink into the porous substrate and disappear._NEWLINE_The upper part of the river was dry for over 3 years starting in November 2003 but re-appeared in February 2007 following several months of above-average rainfall which raised the water table.\"</td>\n",

The elevations within the wilderness range from 800 feet (240\\xc2\\xa0m) in the drainage bottoms to over 5,300 feet (1,600\\xc2\\xa0m) at the top of Old Woman Peak. The mountains take their name from a granite monolith resembling the figure of an old woman, known as the Old Woman Statue (5,000 feet high).\\n_START_SECTION_\\nEcology\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nThe Old Woman Mountains Wilderness falls within a transition zone between the Lower Colorado and Mojave deserts and encompasses many different habitat types. Creosote bush scrub dominates the lower elevations, grading into mixed desert scrub at middle elevations with juniper-pinyon woodland at the higher elevations. The dry washes are characterized by catclaw acacia, cheesebush, desert lavender, little-leaf ratany, and desert almond._NEWLINE_Wildlife is typical for the Mojave Desert; including a permanent population of bighorn sheep, mule deer, bobcat, cougar, coyote, black-tailed jackrabbit, ground squirrels, kangaroo rats, quail, chuckar, roadrunners, rattlesnakes, and several species of lizards. Numerous raptor species are likely to be found in the area; including prairie falcons, red-tailed hawks, golden eagles, Cooper's hawks, American kestrels, as well as several species of owls. The washes and canyons provide good habitat for several species of songbirds, and the bird densities and diversity is further enhanced by the presence of the known 24 springs and seeps._NEWLINE_The bajadas provide excellent desert tortoise habitat; 49,683 acres (201\\xc2\\xa0km\\xc2\\xb2) of the wilderness area have been identified as critical habitat for the threatened desert tortoise.\"</td>\n",

In 1963, he went up to Emmanuel College, Cambridge to read modern and mediaeval languages (French and Spanish); in 1966, he graduated with a First. He continued at Emmanuel as a postgraduate student, and in 1969 was elected to a Research Fellowship. In 1971, he was awarded his PhD for a thesis on 17th-century French sermons. That same year, he was appointed to a college lectureship at, and was elected Fellow of, Gonville and Caius College. In 1974, he was appointed university assistant lecturer in the Department of French; and in 1978, university lecturer._NEWLINE_In 1982, Peter Rickard retired as Drapers Professor of French. Bayley was appointed acting head of department. The process of electing a new Drapers Professor was a protracted one, and he was installed in the chair only in 1985. At that time, it was unusual for Cambridge professors to supervise undergraduates; but Bayley did. Other offices he took on were: various college posts; 1989-1997, vice-president of the Association of University Professors and Heads of French; 1990-1992, president of the Society for French Studies; 1994-1996, member of the executive of the University Council for Modern Languages; and 2000-2002, chairman of the (newly formed) School of Arts and Humanities at Cambridge._NEWLINE_In 2006, he suffered a stroke, and a bad fall. He never fully recovered his faculties, and was unable to complete his monograph on the oratory of Jacques-B\\xc3\\xa9nigne Bossuet (1627-1704). His friends had the novel and distressing experience of finding themselves the dominant partners in conversations. In 2011, he retired, and was presented by his colleagues with a volume in his honour containing contributions by leading scholars from the United Kingdom, France and North America. He increasingly spent his days at the house in Northamptonshire he shared with his life partner Angus Bowie, classicist, of The Queen's College, Oxford; who delivered the eulogy at his funeral in Caius Chapel on 4 May 2018.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nHonours\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nIn 1988, Bayley was made an Officier (Officer) of the Ordre des Palmes Acad\\xc3\\xa9miques by France. In 2006, he was promoted to Commandeur (Commander): this is the highest rank of the order and he was the first British academic under retirement age to achieve it.\"</td>\n",

It was described by a daughter of William Arnold, the first lighthouse keeper, as being shaped like a large meat safe, mounted on a wooden structure resembling a pigeon loft. The keeper had to row from the Tweed Heads Pilot Station each day and light the lantern at sunset, and a hut was constructed for him to stay in._NEWLINE_In October 1878 the Maritime Board of New South Wales decided to construct a modern lighthouse at the location. It was the third of five lighthouses of similar design designed by James Barnet in 1878\\xe2\\x80\\x9380, the other four being Richmond River Light, Clarence River Light (now demolished), Tacking Point Lighthouse and Crowdy Head Light. It originally had a porch and an annexe serving as oil room. A four-room, single-storey lighthouse keeper's house was constructed about 20 metres (66\\xc2\\xa0ft) northwest of the tower. The lighthouse and keeper's cottage were constructed by Joseph William Mortley and Shepherd who were successful with their government tender._NEWLINE_On 15 June 1920 the light was converted to an automatic carbide lamp (acetylene gas) apparatus, with an intensity of 1,500\\xc2\\xa0cd, and altered to group flashing. Soon after, the station was demanned and all buildings other than the tower were demolished._NEWLINE_In 1980 the light was converted to electricity. The current light source is a modern FA-251 Beacon with a 12\\xc2\\xa0Volt 75\\xc2\\xa0Watt HL-2000 quartz halogen lamp. It is fed by mains electricity with a Battery standby. It revolves once every 30 seconds._NEWLINE_The current light characteristic is a flash every five seconds, red to east and white to other directions (Fl.W.R. 5s). It is partially obscured.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nStructure\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nThe circular tower is made from bricks and cement rendered from the outside. It is capped by an oversailing bluestone platform at 12 feet (3.7\\xc2\\xa0m) above ground levels, supported by shaped bluestone corbels. The platform is surrounded by a handrail of metal standards and rails. It is topped by the domed lantern housing the optical apparatus, a fourth order catadioptric.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nSite operation\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nThe light is operated by Roads and Maritime Services (formerly NSW Maritime).

Meanwhile, Jack reconnects with a friend from high school, Nancy Donovan (Julianne Moore), and ponders the possibility of romance as Nancy\\'s marriage is falling apart. When Liz ends up buying an expensive necktie that Jack already owns, they agree to spend zero dollars on their gifts. Jack gets Liz a program from her performance of The Crucible framed in wood from her high school stage \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and does not reimburse his office assistant, Jonathan (Maulik Pancholy) for fuel costs. In return, Liz calls in a bomb threat to Penn Station, keeping Nancy in New York, and finally Jack arranges for Liz to fulfill her dream of meeting Larry Wilcox as Officer Jon Baker from the show CHiPs._NEWLINE_TGS producer Pete Hornberger (Scott Adsit) learns that the new actor on the show, Danny, is a talented singer. Despite Danny\\'s lack of interest in singing on the show, Pete gives him the Christmas solo as revenge for Jenna not chipping in to tip the cleaning ladies, which is a yearly source of frustration for Pete. Jenna is outraged when she hears Danny was assigned the solo, and tries to get Subhas the janitor to punch Danny in the throat. But when the agreeable Danny learns of Jenna\\'s hurt feelings, he arranges for them to perform a duet, in which he sings off-key to make Jenna look good._NEWLINE_Meanwhile, Kenneth is throwing his rule-filled \"Secret Santa Fun Swap\", much to the writers\\' chagrin. Frank, Toofer, and Lutz proclaim they are strict adherents of \"Verdukianism,\" a religion they make up on the spot, and have Kenneth give them things they claim to need for \"Merlinpeen,\" the Verdukian Holiday of Mouth Pleasures (such as meat-lover\\'s pizza and having their teeth flossed by a blonde virgin). Their famous holiday song is, \"Oh, Meatbowl of Verduke, you bring me such pizza. Meatbowl.\" When Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) tells Kenneth that they made up their religion, he goes into shock at the idea that all religions are made up by man. His faith is restored when the three are arrested for the bomb threat Liz called in, using their phone.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nProduction\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\n\"Secret Santa\" was written by series\\' creator, executive producer and lead actress Tina Fey. The director of this episode was Beth McCarthy-Miller, a long-time television director who worked with Fey on the sketch comedy show Saturday Night Live. This was Fey\\'s nineteenth writing credit, and McCarthy-Miller\\'s ninth directed episode. \"Secret Santa\" originally aired on NBC as the eighth episode of the show\\'s fourth season, and the 66th overall episode of the series, in the United States on December 10, 2009. It was filmed on November 5 and November 20, 2009._NEWLINE_In November 2009, it was announced that actress Julianne Moore would guest star on 30 Rock as a love interest for Alec Baldwin\\'s character, Jack Donaghy. Moore would later guest star in the episodes \"Winter Madness\", \"Lee Marvin vs. Derek Jeter\", \"Emanuelle Goes to Dinosaur Land\", and \"I Do Do\". In an interview with USA Today in October 2009, Fey said that Jack would find more enduring love in the upcoming season. \"As we move into the back half of the season, we\\'d like to get [Jack] into a real adult relationship with some hurdles.\" In the same interview, Baldwin noted, \"Fifty-year-old Jack running around still using women like a drug is not where I\\'d like him to end up.\" Actor Larry Wilcox made a cameo in this episode, though, he was in character playing Officer Jon Baker from his old days in the drama show CHiPs, as Liz Lemon had a teen crush on Wilcox. In one scene of this episode, Liz says \"shark farts\", and when asked about it in an April 2010 interview, Fey revealed that the term \"was one that we ad-libbed that we ended up leaving in. The studio asked us not to leave it in, but we left it in.\"_NEWLINE_This was actor Cheyenne Jackson\\'s second appearance as Danny on 30 Rock. He made his debut in the November 12, 2009, episode \"The Problem Solvers\". Fey had seen Jackson in the Broadway musicals Xanadu and Damn Yankees, the latter that starred Jane Krakowski, who plays Jenna Maroney on the show. According to Jackson in a November 2009 interview, Fey set up a meeting to interest him in a role on the program. In an interview with the Los Angeles Times, it was revealed that it was Krakowski who brought Jackson to the attention of the 30 Rock producers. In the episode, Danny sang off-key during a duet with Jenna, in order to keep her happy. In regards of his off-pitch performance, Jackson said in an interview, \"It\\'s actually harder than you might think. I worked on it a lot to make it sound real and to make it sound believable. But I got some good, funny feedback from it, so I\\'m glad it worked out.\"_NEWLINE_One filmed scene from \"Secret Santa\" was cut out from the airing. Instead, the scene was featured on 30 Rock\\'s season four DVD as part of the deleted scenes in the Bonus feature. In the scene, Liz goes to Vattene, a men\\'s dress apparel retailer. She is there to buy a gift for Jack for Christmas but is shocked at the prices. She then sees a red neck tie and purchases it.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nCultural references\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nJack tells Liz about YouFace, \"an up-and-coming social-networking site\", similar to that of MySpace and Facebook. The song Liz sings for Jack\\'s Christmas gift is a parody of the song Anyone Else but You originally by The Moldy Peaches featured in the film Juno. Liz revealed that she played John Proctor \"in a gender-blind\" high school production of The Crucible. In one scene of \"Secret Santa\", Kenneth has multiple arrangements of multicultural holiday decorations in his desk page, which includes a portrait of U.S. President Barack Obama \"for the Muslims.\" Jack promises actor Larry Wilcox an appearance on the reality show Dancing with the Stars, if he visits Liz, until she tells him that the show airs on ABC. When Danny figures out sarcasm, he turns to the camera and says, \"That went well.\" This is the same thing that Rick Mercer does in every episode of the Canadian sitcom Made in Canada.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nReception\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nAccording to the Nielsen ratings system, \"Secret Santa\" was watched by 7.54\\xc2\\xa0million households in its original American broadcast. It earned a 3.5 rating/9 share in the 18\\xe2\\x80\\x9349 demographic, the season high in the 18\\xe2\\x80\\x9349 rating. This means that it was seen by 3.5% of all 18- to 49-year-olds, and 9% of all 18- to 49-year-olds watching television at the time of the broadcast. ABC had an all-repeat evening on December 10, 2009, which helped increase numbers for the other networks. The night this episode broadcast, it was immediately preceded by an episode of The Office\\xe2\\x80\\x94another NBC program\\xe2\\x80\\x94with the same title._NEWLINE_Critical reception of the episode was not entirely favorable. Nathan Rabin of The A.V. Club noted a general decline in the show\\'s quality in the fourth season, and after a return to form in its previous episode, \"Dealbreakers Talk Show #0001\", he found \"Secret Santa\" disappointing, and gave it a grade B\\xe2\\x88\\x92. \"It was cute and nicely plotted\", he wrote \"but it felt a little rote and familiar.\" IGN contributor Robert Canning was more positively inclined. He appreciated Julianne Moore\\'s appearance, but he found that some of the story lines, \"though sprinkled with funny moments, were more successful as sweet tales made for the holiday.\" Bob Sassone of AOL\\'s TV Squad was glad to see Cheyenne Jackson\\'s Danny back on 30 Rock, and noted that the plots concerning Jack and Nancy and Kenneth and the TGS writers, respectively, were \"home runs\". He liked that Tina Fey\\'s character Liz \"was more of a supporting player\" in \"Secret Santa\". Sassone also enjoyed Moore\\'s appearance on the show, commenting that she was \"wicked good\" as Jack\\'s new love interest. Entertainment Weekly\\'s Margaret Lyons wrote that this episode \"had some awesome Liz/Jack moments, a nice little storyline for Pete and Danny, and the invention of a whole new pizza-loving religion.\"_NEWLINE_Meredith Blake, writing for the Los Angeles Times, found that television Christmas episodes generally tended to bring \"an awkward shift in tone: All of a sudden, everyone\\'s being nice to each other.\" She also complained about the invented holiday, which she found to be an overused clich\\xc3\\xa9 of Christmas programming: \"See also: \\'Chrismukkah\\' or \\'Festivus.\\'\" Also, television columnist Alan Sepinwall for The Star-Ledger found that the episode compared unfavorably with the preceding one, but still enjoyed the showcasing of several minor characters, and the \"tender holiday spirit\". What he appreciated most of all, however, was the Alec Baldwin\\xe2\\x80\\x93Julianne Moore angle. Mark Graham of New York magazine opined that the three plots in \"Secret Santa\" could not be considered as \"A-material\" for 30 Rock. Michael Anthony for TV Guide worried about the kiss between Jack and Nancy, as Nancy is married, and experiencing marital troubles. \"The Nancy kiss kind of troubles me; is Jack going to become the \\'other woman?\\'\"'</td>\n",

However, while that setup worked well for major and minor music accompanied by many chords, the performer would only have access to about a single octave of notes while playing - two with a timely shift of registers. The problem was solved in the early 1900s by adding three rows of chromatically ordered single notes next to the standard bass. In 1900 in Moscow Russian master Bakanov made a garmon with piano keyboards for both right and left hands. From 1906 the brothers Kiselevs' factory in Tula began to produce bayans with the three-row free-bass left keyboard._NEWLINE_In the United States, the virtuoso John Serry Sr. designed and built a working model of a Free-bass system to assist in the performance of both classical and symphonic jazz compositions in 1940. It incorporated dual key boards for the soloists' left hand based upon two sets of reeds which were tuned in octaves. This provided the soloist with a total range of tones which exceeded three and one half octaves. The dual keyboard design is illustrated below and was accessed through the use of a switch mechanism to provide independent access for the performers thumb onto Keyboard #2 and the performer's remaining fingers_NEWLINE_onto Keyboard #1._NEWLINE_    Keyboard #2 __F#_G#_A#____C#_D#____F#_G#_A#____C#_D#____F#_G#_A#____C#__NEWLINE_    Keyboard #2 _F__G__A__B__C__D__E__F__G__A__B__C__D__E__F__G__A__B__C__D__NEWLINE_    Keyboard #1 __F#_G#_A#____C#_D#____F#_G#_A#____C#_D#____F#_G#_A#____C#___NEWLINE_    Keyboard #1__F__G__A__B__C__D__E__F__G__A__B__C__D__E__F__G__A__B__C__D_\\n_START_SECTION_\\nPopularizing the free-bass accordion\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nThe Hohner company decided to enlarge the market for accordions by turning the instrument from its traditional music roots into an established instrument for orchestras.  An orchestra was put together, touring Germany to introduce the new concept. The company also supplied sheet music for this new type of accordion. Although these were reportedly popular, it was not until later when the instrument became more widespread._NEWLINE_In Northern Europe, free-bass accordionist Mogens Ellegaard helped popularize the instrument and inspire compositions for it. In an interview he describes how the free-bass accordion was still practically non-existent in his childhood (born 1935), but how composers in his native Denmark began to write works for him since 1958. In 1968 he arranged the manufacture of accordions with nothing but free-bass layouts to accommodate newcomers, as free-bass accordions would otherwise always include standard bass._NEWLINE_In some Russian, Canadian and European music conservatoires, free bass accordion is considered a serious instrument for study and there is now a large modern repertoire for it. Free bass accordion is taught at the undergraduate and post-graduate levels at the National Autonomous University of Mexico in Mexico City. In the United States, free bass instruments are much less well known despite attempts to popularize them by Palmer and Hughes and the Giulietti Accordion Company in the 1960s and 1970s. During this period several American accordionists demonstrated the unique orchestral sound of the instrument through live performances as well as by composing original works which featured the instrument. Included among this group was John Serry, Sr. whose Concerto For Free Bass Accordion was completed during the 1960s. (See Accordion music genres)\"</td>\n",

He had four sons and six daughters. His younger brother, Andrianjakanavalondambo, lived in Alasora during Andrianjakatsitakatrandriana\\'s reign._NEWLINE_As king, Andrianjakatsitakatrandriana soon showed himself to be stubborn and lacking in common sense. Several years into his rule, popular dissatisfaction was widespread. A widely respected political adviser and elder of the noble class named Andriamampandry took it upon himself to examine both brothers and rally the people to support a change in leadership. Andriamampandry visited the king and requested something to eat, but Andrianjakatsitakatrandriana claimed not to have anything available to share on that day. Before leaving, Andriamampandry asked the king, \"How many hearts do you have?\", to which the king replied that he had only one heart. Andriamampandry then visited prince Andrianjakanavalondambo, who acknowledged that it should normally be the king\\'s right to enjoy the honor of showing hospitality to Andriamampandry, but offered to share his meal with the elder nonetheless. Afterward, Andriamampandry asked the prince how many hearts he had, to which the prince replied that he had two._NEWLINE_Three versions of the events that followed Andriamampandry\\'s initial assessment of the two brothers were recorded in the mid-19th century Tantara ny Andriana eto Madagasikara, the first documenting of Merina oral history. In the first version, Andriamampandry rallied the public in a speech that retold his experience with the brothers and explained in figurative terms the selfishness of men with one heart and the generosity and empathy of men with two hearts. Andriamampandry then left the gathering and was halfway to the royal palace when he was stopped by a man named Andriamanalina who offered to express the people\\'s concerns to the king. The two traveled to the palace and Andriamanalina requested an audience. When an attendant asked his reason for wishing to see the king, Andriamanalina responded with a lengthy condemnation and then departed. Afterward the king discussed Andriamanalina\\'s diatribe with Andriamampandry, who explained that the people were dissatisfied with him and advised him to leave the palace. The king departed, and at the same time the prince left Alasora to travel to his brother\\'s palace. _NEWLINE_The first version of the story relates that during the king\\'s absence Andriamampandry burned down the village at Andohalo, just outside the palace walls. The king returned having been universally lambasted, to find Andohalo burned and his younger brother occupying the palace under a new name - Andriamasinavalona - given to him by Andriamampandry. Andrianjakatsitakatrandriana fled to the coastal Kingdom of Boina, where he enticed a number of Sakalava soldiers to fight with him to retake the palace. The soldiers had not expected such a long journey, however, and abandoned Andrianjakatsitakatrandriana before reaching the highlands. Defeated, Andrianjakatsitakatrandriana returned to the capital and offered his submission to his younger brother. Andriamasinavalona sent him to live out his days in the village of Ankadimbahoaka._NEWLINE_The variations on this narrative are fundamentally similar. A second version recounts that the prince described himself as having \"three hearts, two hearts, and one heart\" (rather than just two hearts), and explains that Andriamampandry tricked the king into leaving the palace by instructing him to journey to a distant location to sacrifice a zebu to the ancestors. In the third version, a primary role is given to the sampy (royal idol) named Kelimalaza, to which the success of Andriamasinavalona\\'s coup is attributed.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nDeath\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nAndrianjakatsitakatrandriana died in Ankadimbahoaka and was buried in Ambohimanatrika.

Many Jews had reached Great Britain from different parts of Nazi-occupied Europe, most of them settling in London. Since Orthodox Judaism places great emphasis on the upbringing of children, he saw a need for a school where the children could be educated in an Orthodox Jewish environment._NEWLINE_The boys\\xe2\\x80\\x99 school became a voluntary aided Local Authority School in 1957. In September 1975, the girls moved to the present purpose-built Page Street site in Mill Hill.

In April 1994, the school became grant maintained, but returned to Voluntary Aided Status in September 1999, following the abolition of grant-maintained schools. In March 2008 Hasmonean was singled out as one of the faith schools in the news for its procedure of demanding contributions from parents as a condition of entry.

Her attacks have been listed in the Guinness Book of World Records as the highest number of fatalities from a tiger. She was shot in 1907 by Jim Corbett.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nHistory\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nAccording to Peter Byrne, professional hunter and author from Nepal, the tiger began her attacks in a Rupal village in western Nepal, Himalayas. Hunters were sent in to kill the tiger, but she managed to evade them. Eventually, the Nepalese Army was called in. Despite failing to capture or kill the tiger, soldiers organised a massive beat and managed to force the tiger to abandon her territory and drive her across the border (river Sarda) into India, where she continued her killing activities in the Kumaon District. The tiger would adjust her hunting strategy so as to best hunt and evade humans; traveling great distances between villages (as much as 20 miles in a day) in her new territory both to claim new victims and evade pursuers; her behavior becoming more like a Siberian tiger in her habits and creating a larger territory to encompass multiple villages in the Kumaon area, with Champawat being close to the center of her territory. Most of her victims consisted of young women and children, as they were the ones most at risk thanks to their habit of going into the forest to collect resources for feeding livestock, collecting firewood, and for crafting. All her kills happened during the daylight (as Corbett writes, he is not aware of a single case of a man-eating tiger killing a human during the night). Life across the region grew paralyzed, with men often refusing to leave their huts for work after hearing the tiger\\'s roars from the forest._NEWLINE_In 1907, the tiger was killed by British hunter Jim Corbett. The tiger had killed a 16-year-old girl, Premka Devi, in the village of Fungar, near to the town of Champawat, and left a trail of blood, which Corbett followed. After nearly getting ambushed by the tiger while investigating the remains of its victim and scaring her off with two shots from his rifle, Corbett had to abandon the hunt, deciding to use villagers and to organize a beat the next day in the Champa River gorge. _NEWLINE_With the help of the tehsildar of Champawat, the beat was organized with about 300 villagers, and the next day, about noon, Corbett shot the tigress dead. Corbett\\'s first shots hit the tigress in the chest and shoulder, and his last shot, made with the tehsildar\\'s rifle to keep it from charging him after he ran out of bullets, hit the cat in the foot, causing it to collapse 6\\xc2\\xa0m (20\\xc2\\xa0ft) from him.  _NEWLINE_A postmortem on the tigress showed the upper and lower canine teeth on the right side of her mouth were broken, the upper one in half, the lower one right down to the bone. This injury, a result of an old gunshot, according to Corbett, probably prevented her from hunting her natural prey, and hence, she started to hunt humans. Further examinations made by Corbett during his hunt for the tiger indicated that the cat was in healthy condition physically (other than her teeth), and that she was between 10 and 12 years old.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nChampawat town\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nIn Champawat, near the Chataar Bridge and on the way to Lohaghat, there is a \"cement board\" marking the place where the tigress was finally brought down.

The essential point that seems to emerge from the participatory and furtive experience of these meetings is based on its intersubjective, nourishing and exploratory aspects that rally at each subsequent meeting.

This particular workshop, held at Inter/Le Lieu, centre en art actuel (Quebec City, Quebec, Canada), was attended by those who would be Le Tas Invisibles founding members._NEWLINE_The collective\\'s first Performance Monthly meetings or Performance Monthlies (PMs), which since its inception advocates for the inclusion of all the participants in \"accidental\" and \"fleeting\" (from the French, \"furtive\") performances within the public spaces (or alternative spaces) on the basis of voluntary, free association and anonymity, took place from 2013 to 2014 in the City of Quebec. In 2014, a first \"tas invisible\" (invisible gathering) was held in Ottawa. Moreover, in 2014, a first geographically-dispersed tas invisible took place simultaneously in two cities \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Quebec City (Quebec) and Grande Prairie (Alberta). As such, the collective opts for multi-site, simultaneous manifestations despite differences of time and space. In 2014, Le Tas Invisible travelled to Northern Ireland in order to participate in a festival at Belfast presented by the Bbeyond collective, which is internationally acclaimed for its contribution to innovate performance art._NEWLINE_The collective\\'s activities have also included projects such as an artist\\'s residency at Flax International, during which they performed in Derry. In 2016, Le Tas Invisible was dormant for six months. Thereafter, the collective resumed its activities in full force. New branches of the collective have sprouted in many cities in the province of Quebec, such as in Montr\\xc3\\xa9al and Rimouski in 2016, and in 2017, in Trois-Rivi\\xc3\\xa8res. In 2014, a \"tas\" in Ottawa/Gatineau become active, multiplying its members and manifestation from 2016 onwards. Occasionally, the collective performs by including international contributors from countries such as Germany and Spain, or members perform in other cities (for example in Bratislava, Madrid, Nice, Tel Aviv). They need no formal invitation to perform and manifest themselves through action. Therefore, those who act are indeed Le Tas._NEWLINE_On September 22, 2016, the various splinters groups of Le Tas Invisible acted in synchronicity with an international gathering of performance art called the Rencontre internationale d\\'art performance (RiAP), organized by Inter/Le Lieu. As a discrete manifestation presented outside of the official festival, the global event was called Equinox to Equinox: Same Difference. Initiated by the collective Bbeyond, to which Le Tas Invisible was invited to collaborate, the manifestation included more than 37 groups of performers performing simultaneously throughout the world. On September 22, 2017, for exceptional reasons, Le Tas Invisible decided to out its own invisibility for a day in support of the Day of Public Action for Freedom and Democracy.

He subsequently served as a captain and lieutenant-colonel in the Coldstream Guards from 1710 to 1711._NEWLINE_Abercrombie was returned unopposed as Member of Parliament (MP) for Dysart Burghs at a by-election on 16 January 1710 and held the seat until the dissolution of parliament  on 21 September 1710. He chose not to stand for re-election, and his successor as the member for Dysart Burghs, James Oswald, was elected unopposed at the 1710 British general election._NEWLINE_Abercrombie became lieutenant-colonel on 20 March 1711 and brevet colonel on 1 November 1711. On 24 October 1712, he became Town Major (Lieutenant-Governor) of Dunkirk and as such, oversaw the evacuation of French forces and the installation of an allied garrison, holding the post for the rest of his life. He was commissioner for inspecting the demolition of Dunkirk fortifications from 1713  to 1716,  accumulating extensive arrears of pay and allowance. He spent some time chasing what he was owed, and had to sell his regiment to make ends meet._NEWLINE_Abercrombie was probably unmarried and died without surviving male issue at his home in Charing Cross on 14 November 1724. The baronetcy became extinct on his death.'</td>\n",

The game is the first entry in the Grand Theft Auto series to make use of an original score. In collaboration with each other, the musicians produced over twenty hours of music which scores the game\\'s missions. Some of the works produced by the musicians throughout the game\\'s development influenced some of the in-game missions and sparked inspiration for further score development. Grand Theft Auto V also has an in-game radio that can tune into sixteen stations playing more than 441 tracks of licensed music, as well as two talk radio stations. The composers of the score wanted it to accompany the licensed music, as opposed to detracting from it._NEWLINE_The game\\'s music has been released on three official soundtracks: The Music of Grand Theft Auto V, released alongside the initial launch of the game, consists of three volumes comprising the score, and selections from the in-game radio; The Cinematographic Score \\xe2\\x80\\x94 GTA 5, an electronic album released in March 2014, comprises tracks composed and produced by Tangerine Dream founder Edgar Froese; and Welcome to Los Santos, released with the Microsoft Windows version of the game, features songs from the in-game radio station \"The Lab\", produced by The Alchemist and Oh No. Critical reception to the soundtracks was positive, as reviewers felt that the music connected appropriately with the gameplay.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nRadio station music\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nSince the game\\'s location is modelled on Southern California, the developers attempted to create an accurate representation of Californian music. Production of the soundtrack also consisted of licensing music for the radio stations, and selecting a DJ that matches the genre of music the station hosts. The soundtrack consists of a wide variety of radio stations that play different genres of music, including reggae, hip hop, pop and country. The game also features an original and dynamic score composed by Tangerine Dream, Woody Jackson, Alchemist and Oh No which plays out in several selective missions. Selected tracks from the score were later released on The Music of Grand Theft Auto V. In September 2014, it was announced that new songs would be added to some of the radio stations in the next-gen releases of the game._NEWLINE_In developing the radio stations, the development team sought to reinforce the game\\'s recreation of California by licensing tracks they felt appropriately echoed a \"Cali feel\". On the inclusion of the pop station Non-Stop-Pop FM, music supervisor Ivan Pavlovich noted \"the first time you get off an airplane in L.A. and you hear the radio and the pop just seeps out... We wanted that. It really connects you to the world\". He felt that music licensing for the game involved a greater discernment than in Grand Theft Auto IV, as the music in Grand Theft Auto V played a greater role in building a Californian atmosphere. \"It reflects the environment in which the game is set\", he explained. Initially, the team planned to license over 900 tracks for the radio, but over time they refined the total number of tracks to 241._NEWLINE_The tracks are shared between eighteen stations, and the radio also includes two talk-back stations. Some of the tracks were written specifically for the game; for example, rapper and producer Flying Lotus hosts the station FlyLo FM which includes original work he composed for the game. As Pavlovich noted, for each of the radio stations, over time the team would develop an understanding of where the station\\'s music was going and then select a DJ to host the station. Each station\\'s DJ was selected with the mindset that they would match the genre of music the station hosts; for example, in developing Los Santos Rock Radio the team licensed classic rock tracks, and thus Kenny Loggins became a fitting choice for the station\\'s DJ.'</td>\n",

After witnessing the antics of Mark Cuban at a Dallas Mavericks game, Burns tries to win over Springfield basketball fans with his own antics. Burns fails miserably, and decides to build a luxurious sports arena. Meanwhile, Jimbo, Dolph, and Kearney dare Bart to prank the second graders by hitting a beehive with his slingshot. Lisa discovers, however, the bees that should be in the hive are dead. Groundskeeper Willie explains the bees are dying all over Springfield by loss of habitat, thus contracting a fatal disease. Lisa seeks help from Homer (who at first was unwilling to save the bees until Lisa informs him that the bees make honey and, if they died, there will be no more honey) and Professor Frink who has an uninfected queen bee sting Lisa releasing pheromones which attracts many uninfected bees, which form a bee beard. After trying to keep the bees in the Simpson home, Lisa and Marge find an abandoned greenhouse for the bees to live in. However, the site of the greenhouse is exactly where Mr. Burns plans to construct his new arena._NEWLINE_Lisa attempts to convince the town to save the bee population, but despite her logical protest that they always get into trouble when they ignore her advice, she fails when Burns informs everyone about the amazing features of his arena and threatens to trade the Excitement\\'s recent draft pick and fan favorite, Alaskan native and Eskimo Muk Mu. Lisa becomes depressed that the bee population is slowly dying. Homer and Moe attempt to help save the bees by mating a queen bee from Lisa\\'s hive with Moe\\'s Africanized bees to create a hybrid bee species strong enough to survive anywhere. On the night of the grand opening of Burns\\' sports arena, Homer takes Lisa to the top of a hill and shows her the hive containing the hybrid bees. When Homer accidentally releases them, the bees attack Burns\\' new arena which resembles a bee hive. In the end, the arena is legally declared a bee sanctuary, enabling the bees to survive. At the next billionaires\\' retreat, Mr. Burns reveals how much the bees cost him. After it is discovered that he is four million dollars short of a billion he is kicked out of the retreat and into the millionaires\\' camp. Much to his horror, these millionaires got rich thanks to their low-class businesses, such as a minor-league hockey team.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nProduction\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nThe episode was written by Stephanie Gillis and directed by Mark Kirkland. Billionaires Mark Cuban and Jeff Bezos and sportscaster Marv Albert guest star as themselves. The episode marks a second use of the Christmas-themed opening, first seen in \"Kill Gil, Volumes I & II\".\\n_START_SECTION_\\nCultural references\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nLisa\\'s subplot refers to the worldwide disappearance of bees known as Colony Collapse Disorder. In a scene where Homer imagines a future without honey, a small green robot resembling WALL-E from the 2008 film WALL-E, gives him a bottle of honey and then turns Homer into a cube. The bee tombstone that set Jerry Seinfeld a reference to the 2007 film Bee Movie where Seinfeld played as the voice of Barry. The Billionaires\\' Retreat is the parody of the Bohemian Club._NEWLINE_In the opening sequence, Mr. Burns appears to be Ebenezer Scrooge with Smithers as Jacob Marley from A Christmas Carol. The statue of Mr. Burns outside his new basketball arena is based on the Nike, Inc. \"Jumpman\" logo featuring Michael Jordan. Just before Burns is thrown out of the Billionaires\\' retreat, he asks Mark Cuban if he can let him \"off the hook, for old times\\' sake\" and Cuban refuses, referring to the scene in the 1972 film The Godfather in which Salvatore Tessio is led away to be executed after being revealed as a traitor. The Billionaires play Quidditch, as it is depicted in the Harry Potter film series, and use the paintings Mona Lisa by Leonardo da Vinci, Whistler\\'s Mother by James Abbott McNeill Whistler and The Scream by Edvard Munch as target practice._NEWLINE_The songs featured in the episode include \"Hip Hop Hooray\" by Naughty by Nature during Mr. Burns\\' attempt to be more like Mark Cuban, and \"Sea of Love\" as performed by The Honeydrippers, which Homer and Moe play to their bees. Scott Joplin\\'s \"Maple Leaf Rag\" is also played in the episode.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nReception\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nIn its original airing, the episode garnered 6.19 million viewers. The episode received mixed reviews from critics. _NEWLINE_Robert Canning of IGN gave the episode 7/10 and said that with an episode like this \"I just don\\'t laugh as much as I would have liked\". _NEWLINE_Steve Heisler of The A.V. Club gave the episode a grade of B and said that episode was \"okay\", but \"boring\". _NEWLINE_Erich Asperschlager of TV Verdict wrote: \"Part of me knows that the only way to enjoy the modern incarnation of The Simpsons is to stop expecting its stories to make sense. [The episode is] not straightforward at all. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s like sometime after the tenth season, The Simpsons writers started using Mad Libs to generate story ideas. In fact, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got a sneaking suspicion the only reason this episode exists is because someone came up with the title \\'The Burns and the Bees\\' and just had to make it work.\" _NEWLINE_Harry Shearer received a nomination for a Primetime Emmy Award for Emmy Award for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance for his role as Mr. Burns, Smithers, Lenny and Dr. Hibbert in this episode, but lost to fellow Simpsons cast member Dan Castellaneta. _NEWLINE_Stephanie Gillis was nominated for a Writers Guild of America Award in the Animation category in 2010 for writing the episode. The Simpsons was the only show to be nominated in the category, with the other nominated episodes being \"Take My Life, Please\", \"Eeny Teeny Maya Moe\", \"Gone Maggie Gone\" and \"Wedding for Disaster\".

De Lotbini\\xc3\\xa8re inherited the title Marquis de Lotbini\\xc3\\xa8re in 1798, but he never used it. This choice was probably to keep political favor with the new rulers of Canada as his father had been in constant and open opposition to British rule for which in 1784 he had been awarded the Marquisate.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nMilitary life\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nAged eleven, he served as a cadet during the Siege of Quebec in 1759. The following year he was gazetted second ensign with the French Army when they were stationed in Montreal before accompanying his father to France. In France, he resumed his studies with the thought of joining the French cavalry, but following the Treaty of Paris (1763) and the consequent loss of his father's land in America, he returned to Quebec and was commissioned as a military surveyor in 1768._NEWLINE_From 1770, his father had incurred many debts, so with the financial help of his father's friend Charles-Fran\\xc3\\xa7ois Tarieu de La Naudi\\xc3\\xa8re, he kept the seigneuries of Lotbiniere, Vaudreuil, Rigaud and Rigaud de Vaudreuil (which he sold in 1772 to his uncle) in the family by purchasing them from his father. Although only in his early twenties, through his immense properties, prestigious name and family connections he was now one of the most influential Canadian seigneurs._NEWLINE_Unlike his father, he immediately recognised the importance of working with the British and he therefore adapted himself to the circumstances in which he found himself. After the American invasion of Montreal in 1775, he was one of the first Canadian seigneurs to offer his services to the Governor Guy Carleton, 1st Baron Dorchester. He helped to defend Fort St Johns (later Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu) against the Americans, but was captured and taken prisoner by them and removed to Albany, New York. It was during this time that he developed a strong friendship with William Bingham, whose only son later went on to marry one of his daughters. He was released in 1776, and on returning to Montreal in 1777, having won Carleton's trust, he was appointed a Justice of the Peace. He continued to serve in the Canadian militia and in 1794 became Lieutenant-Colonel of the Vaudreuil Battalion of Militia. In 1803, he was made a full Colonel, finally retiring from the militia in 1818. He died at his home in Montreal, 1822.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nLanguage debate, 1793\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nIn the Legislative Assembly of Lower Canada, Lotbini\\xc3\\xa8re was elected Speaker in the 1st Parliament of Lower Canada, having entered with his brother-in-law, Pierre-Amable de Bonne, for the riding of York which took in his seigneuries of Vaudreuil and Rigaud, Quebec.

The couple subsequently divorced._NEWLINE_In 1971, while identifying as an Orthodox Jew (though she previously and later identified as Reform Jewish), she published an article entitled \"The Jew Who Wasn\\'t There: Halacha and the Jewish Woman,\"  in Davka magazine; according to historian Paula Hyman, this article was a trailblazer in analyzing the status of Jewish women using feminism._NEWLINE_In 1972, she published an article entitled \"Tum\\'ah and Toharah: Ends and Beginnings.\" In this article she argued that the ritual immersion of a niddah (a menstruating woman) in a mikveh did not \"oppress or denigrate women.\" Instead, she argued, such immersion constituted a ritual reenactment of \"death and resurrection\" that was actually \"equally accessible to men and women.\" However, she eventually renounced this position.  In her essay \"In Your Blood, Live: Re-visions of a Theology of Purity\", published in Tikkun in 1993, she wrote \"purity and impurity do not constitute a cycle through which all members of society pass, as I argued in my [1972] essay. Instead, impurity and purity define a class system in which the most impure people are women.\"_NEWLINE_In 1983, she published an essay in Moment entitled \"I\\'ve Had Nothing Yet, So I Can\\'t Take More,\" in which she criticized rabbinic tradition for making women \"a focus of the sacred rather than active participants in its processes,\" and declared that being a Jewish woman \"is very much like being Alice at the Hatter\\'s tea party. We did not participate in making the rules, nor were we there at the beginning of the party.\"_NEWLINE_In 1992, she began a women\\'s Talmud class in her home, teaching the text (in its original Hebrew and Aramaic). This created the first rigorous Talmud study opportunity for lay women outside of New York and Israel._NEWLINE_Adler received a PhD in Religion from the University of Southern California in 1997; her doctoral dissertation was titled \"Justice and Peace Have Kissed: A Feminist Theology of Judaism.\"  She is the author of many articles that have appeared in Blackwell\\'s Companion to Feminist Philosophy, Beginning Anew: A Woman\\'s Companion to the High Holy Days, Contemporary Jewish Religious Thought, Lifecycles, The Jewish Condition, and On Being a Jewish Feminist._NEWLINE_She was awarded the 2000 Tuttleman Foundation Book Award of Gratz College and the 1999 National Jewish Book Award for Jewish Thought by the Jewish Book Council for her book  Engendering Judaism: An Inclusive Theology and Ethics; this was the first time the National Jewish Book Award for Jewish Thought was ever awarded to a female theologian. Among the book\\'s contributions to Jewish thoughts was the creation of a new ritual, brit ahuvim, to replace the traditional erusin marriage ceremony, which Adler viewed as not according with feminist ideals of equality between the sexes._NEWLINE_Originally a Reform Jew, but converting to Orthodox Judaism in her teens, Adler made her final spiritual home in the Reform movement.

Subjects are exposed to a suspected occupational agent in a controlled way under close supervision in a hospital laboratory. The specific inhalation challenges has been considered as the gold standard in confirming the diagnosis of occupational asthma.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nMethods\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nOne of the steps of SIC is to perform a challenge with the suspected asthmagen.

The patient enters a sealed chamber and is exposed to the suspected agent in a controlled, non-work, test environment. The asthmagen can be water-soluble and nebulized. If the agent is non-soluble, the patient tips the agent from one tray to another in an attempt to mimic the work environment. This method has the advantage of being able to assess, albeit highly subjectively,ocular and nasal symptoms as well as a reduction in FEV\\xe2\\x82\\x81._NEWLINE_There are, however, disadvantages to the method. First, SIC is currently only conducted in specialty facilities because the facilities and equipment are rare and expensive. Second, the realistic method may exposed the patient to huge concentrations of particles, resulting in unduly severe asthma attacks. Alternately, the agent can be delivered using the recently developed closed-circuit technique.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nClosed-circuit method\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nThis test requires the patient to breathe aerosols of the suspected agent (asthmagen) through an oro-facial mask or mouth piece. These asthmagens are aerosolized using closed-circuit chambers, and the quantities and concentrations administered being minute and extremely stable minimize the risk of exaggerated responses.'</td>\n",

Brightman\\n_START_SECTION_\\nEarly life and education\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nBrightman was born on September 20, 1884 in Holbrook, Massachusetts, and was the only child of a Methodist pastor. He studied at Brown University from which he graduated with a BA degree in 1907, and then with an MA degree in 1908. He then proceeded to Boston University where he was awarded the Bachelor of Sacred Theology degree in 1910, followed by a PhD in 1912. He undertook further studies in Italy at the University of Berlin and Marburg University between 1901 and 1910._NEWLINE_While at Brown, Brightman became a brother of the Kappa Sigma Fraternity._NEWLINE_He was ordained a Methodist minister in 1912.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nCareer\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nBrightman was a professional philosopher who taught the subject at Nebraska Wesleyan University between 1912 and 1915. He then took up a post as lecturer in ethics and religion at the Wesleyan University in Connecticut from 1915 to 1919. Finally, he moved to Boston University in 1919 and taught philosophy there until he died on February 25, 1953. From 1925 to 1953 he occupied the Borden Parker Bowne chair of Philosophy._NEWLINE_One of his earliest publications reflected the findings of higher criticism in Old Testament studies concerning the identification of sub-sources and sub-documents within the first six books of the Bible (the Hexateuch). The Documentary Hypothesis that Brightman drew upon had developed in Nineteenth Century German Biblical studies and had received their definitive form in the writings of Julius Wellhausen. Wellhausen, and those who built on his theories, argued that the first five books of the Bible (the Pentateuch) were a composite creation drawing on four original sources and edited into their final form in the fourth century BC. These conclusions ran counter to the traditional Jewish and Christian position that Moses received the Pentateuch from God, with little if any further modification. Brightman was attacked for his pro-Wellhausian views by conservative and fundamentalist Methodists, and blacklisted._NEWLINE_In his involvement with the Methodist Church in America, Brightman joined the Methodist Federation for Social Action. He also supported conscientious objectors in war, was a member of the American Civil Liberties Union, and also the Committee on Peace through Justice.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nPhilosophical stance\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nBrightman\\'s philosophical views were influenced by the thought of Borden Parker Bowne (1847\\xe2\\x80\\x931910).  Bowne, who was a Methodist philosopher, emphasized the importance of personality and self-image, and encapsulated his ideas in the expression \"transcendent empiricism\".  By this Bowne meant that there was an existent reality beyond mere human sensory perceptions.  He held to the importance of intuition in understanding reality, and upheld the role of human free will.  In many ways Bowne\\'s work on personality anticipated some of the views of Sigmund Freud, and even Albert Einstein\\'s findings on the relativity of time and space.  Bowne\\'s emphasis on personality led to his philosophical views being known by the term personalism._NEWLINE_Brightman was an advocate of Bowne\\'s position on personality, and those who gathered around both Bowne\\'s and Brightman\\'s writings became known as a movement called Boston personalism.  In Brightman\\'s system of thought the human self is the dominant metaphysical reality.  His philosophical method in argument is known as rational empiricism._NEWLINE_In addition to building on Bowne\\'s position, Brightman is credited with developing a metaphysical view in the philosophy of religion called finitistic theism.  For Brightman God is a self-limited being whose good will though perfect is constrained by God\\'s own nature.  There is a dynamic relationship between God and the world that grows and develops, or is in process.  In Brightman\\'s thought God\\'s purposes intend good for the world, yet pain and suffering occur.  He did not argue for God having unlimited power over evil and suffering, but rather maintained that through the processes of the world and history evil will be overcome.  In effect, God uses the tragedies of the creation as instruments that enable the world to reach its final goal._NEWLINE_Brightman\\'s views about the growing and developing relationship between God and the world has strong affinities with process philosophy as espoused by Alfred North Whitehead and Charles Hartshorne. Indeed, Hartshorne and Brightman maintained a lengthy and lively correspondence on these matters for a period of some twenty three years._NEWLINE_Edgar Brightman was a teacher and mentor to Martin Luther King Jr. as King pursued his PhD at Boston University in the early 1950s. (Following Brightman\\'s death, Lotan Harold DeWolf, who had himself received his 1935 PhD in philosophy studying under Brightman, became King\\'s dissertation adviser and another significant influence on King\\'s theological and philosophical thinking.) Brightman\\'s influence is reflected in King\\'s philosophy of Nonviolence, most markedly in the sixth and most fundamental principle of King\\'s philosophy of Nonviolence, \"The arc of the Universe is long, but it bends toward justice.\"'</td>\n",

His sister was the famous opera singer Nancy Storace. He was born in London in the Parish of St Marylebone to an English mother and Italian father.  Relatively little is known through direct records of his life, and most details are known second-hand through the memoirs of his contemporaries Michael Kelly, the actor John Bannister, and the oboist William Thomas Parke.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nEarly years and education in Italy\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nHis father, Stefano Storace (b. Torre Annunziata, ca. 1725; d. London, ca. 1781), an Italian contrabassist and composer, taught him the violin so well that at ten years old he played successfully the most difficult music of the day.  The composer\\'s youth was spent entirely in the company of musicians, since his father (also a composer and arranger) was the Musical Director of Vauxhall Gardens. Mistrusting the quality of musical education available in England, Stefano Storace sent his son to Italy to study, at the Conservatorio di Sant\\' Onofrio, Naples. Stephen neglected his musical studies in Italy, and went on painting expeditions with Thomas Jones. His interest in art may not have been entirely extinguished, however \\xe2\\x80\\x93 unlike the works of any of his English contemporaries, the printed vocal scores of all his operas feature elaborate engravings of what are presumed to be the stage-designs, and it is suggested that these drawings were Stephen\\'s own work.  No other artist, at least, seems to have claimed credit for them.  Towards the end of their studies, Stephen and Nancy first made the acquaintance of Michael Kelly, whom they encountered by chance in Livorno.  Kelly was with English-speaking friends, and ventured an opinion (in English) as to whether the young person with Stephen was a boy or a girl.  \"The person is a she-animal\" retorted an offended Nancy in English as the first remark in what would be a lifelong friendship with both the Storaces.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nEarly professional employment in Vienna, 1785\\xe2\\x80\\x931787\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nStephen Storace returned to England sometime between the years of 1780 and 1782, most likely to settle his father\\'s affairs after his death in Naples, which probably happened around 1780\\xe2\\x80\\x931781. Nancy, accompanied by her mother, Elizabeth, went to Vienna in January 1783. Nancy entered into an arranged marriage, (most likely arranged by her mother) to the English violinist and composer, John Fisher, in March 1784. The marriage only lasted a few months. It is unclear how Stephen obtained his first commission to compose an Italian opera for the Viennese stage, but the commission was most likely obtained by Nancy sometime in the fall of 1784, with Stephen arriving in Vienna sometime in late December of that same year._NEWLINE_Stephen produced his first opera, Gli Sposi malcontenti, at Vienna, on 1 June 1785. The premiere, however, was marred by further scandal involving his sister, who was singing the prima buffa role \\xe2\\x80\\x93 she collapsed on-stage in mid-aria, causing the performance to be abandoned. Nancy was pregnant during the premiere of I sposi malcontenti and gave birth to a baby girl a few weeks later. The child was given to a foundling home by Elizabeth Storace, who claimed that it belonged to Nancy\\'s estranged husband, John Fisher, who had been banished by the Emperor some months earlier for beating Nancy. Elizabeth Storace claimed that they did not care if the child lived or died. The child died in the foundling home a month after she was born. Nancy\\'s return to the stage four months later was marked by the performance of  Per la ricuperata salute di Ofelia, composed specially for the occasion by a trio of composers \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Mozart, Salieri, and the unknown \"Cornetti\" (which may have been a pen-name for Stephen, Salieri, or even perhaps Emperor Joseph II). This rare example of a Mozart-Salieri collaboration was just discovered in 2016. In Vienna the Storaces made the acquaintance of Mozart, in whose Le nozze di Figaro Nancy sang Susanna at the premiere, and Kelly sang Don Curzio. The \"English circle\" in Vienna also included the composer Thomas Attwood. In Vienna Stephen produced a second opera, Gli equivoci, founded on Shakespeare\\'s The Comedy of Errors.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nThe English Operas, 1787\\xe2\\x80\\x931796\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nThere is no clear explanation why the Storaces abandoned Vienna at the height of their success there. The reasons are suggested to be more personal than professional. Certainly the Emperor spoke of her with great admiration, even using her abilities as an arbitrary unit of currency \\xe2\\x80\\x93 \"I\\'d not give you a Storace for it!\". Quite possibly Nancy was under pressure from Elizabeth, who was not at all happy in Vienna, and wished to return to England with both of her children in tow. Nancy left Vienna in February 1787, along with her \"entourage\" of Michael Kelly, her brother, and Thomas Attwood. Buoyed-up by their success on the Viennese stage, the coach-party which left for London could not have imagined they would find themselves rejected and unwanted in London, where their names were quite forgotten after such a long absence. Stephen was remembered \\xe2\\x80\\x93 if at all \\xe2\\x80\\x93 as an infant prodigy violinist at Vauxhall Gardens, and found it very hard to secure paying work without the cherubic charm of youth behind him, and moreover as an unknown composer._NEWLINE_Both Nancy and Stephen imagined they might find work at the King\\'s Theatre, which was \\xe2\\x80\\x93 at that time \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the home of the Royal Italian Opera, a troupe which enjoyed a Royal monopoly on the presentation of Italian opera, and in fact of any musical works which were through-composed without dialogue.  Kelly succeeded in getting a few roles there (on the basis of his wider professional experience, knowing roles the King\\'s Theatre already had in repertoire, and his legendary charm), but both Storaces found themselves excluded by the group of native Italian musicians already well-established there. Stephen too worked at the King\\'s Theatre as music director for some operas, including his own La Cameriera Astuta, before moving in 1789 to the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, which at this time was under the management of Richard Brinsley Sheridan.  Sheridan\\'s personal interest in the theatre had largely dried-up by this point in his career, and he was more interested in politics \\xe2\\x80\\x93 his theatrical interests were primarily financial, and he had established a successful format of lavish musical spectaculars, more remarkable for their visual than musical content.  To evade the Royal monopoly on opera at the King\\'s Theatre, Sheridan presented a mixture of Singspiel-type works specially written in English in the ballad-opera style, with \"English\\'d\" versions of popular operas playing in continental Europe in which he saw some commercial opportunity. Stephen Storace\\'s first job at Drury Lane was to make an \"English\" version of Dittersdorf\\'s German Singspiel Doktor und Apotheker, which appeared in English as Doctor & Apothecary in 1787 in Storace\\'s version.  The work of making \"English\" versions was not just a question of translation \\xe2\\x80\\x93 all complicated musical numbers (especially trios, quartets etc.) had to be \"cut\" to make them performable by English casts who were primarily pantomime comedians without any great musical talent.  This also meant transposition of some numbers, making a fresh English text, cutting whole numbers and replacing them with dialogue, and sometimes inserting new comic songs and \"patter-songs\" which the public greatly enjoyed._NEWLINE_Stephen quickly established his credentials with Sheridan as a young man who could quickly and competently produce good results. He also had an impresario\\'s skill for judging what would make good box-office and bring in good receipts, and he took to adding famous numbers from the Vienna stage to \"spice-up\" works which needed it. Seeing that the repertoire of the King\\'s Theatre was still largely made-up of opera seria works about ancient gods or monarchs of antiquity, Storace spotted a niche in the market for the new \"romantic\" style of ghost-stories, gothic horror, and romance, and his first purpose-written work for Drury Lane employed all these elements.  The Haunted Tower (1789) was a box-office sensation, selling out for 50 nights in succession.  No little part of the success was the performance of Michael Kelly in the male lead role. Up to this time, high notes in the male parts in the theatre had been crooned falsetto by performers who were more actors than singers. Kelly\\'s aria to the ghost of the Haunted Tower \\xe2\\x80\\x93 \"Spirit of My Sainted Sire!\" included a top B\\xe2\\x99\\xad which he took in full voice in the Italian style, and proved such a success that at most performances it was encored in full. This aria outlived the rest of Storace\\'s output by decades, and was still being reprinted in parlour songbook anthologies for the amateur tenor a century later._NEWLINE_However, The Haunted Tower still included \"borrowings\" from other composers on whose reputations tickets might be sold, and Sheridan remained adamant \\xe2\\x80\\x93 despite the success of the piece \\xe2\\x80\\x93 that he did not want Storace composing fresh work as a regular occurrence. Storace was put to work producing an \"English\" version of Gretry\\'s Richard, Coeur du Lion, with the unfortunate difficulty that John Bannister \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the famous tragedian \\xe2\\x80\\x93 was cast in the main role, and was tone-deaf. No amount of re-writing could get around the problem that Richard was supposed to sing his famous ballad so that Blondin would hear it outside the castle walls. As so often in Storace\\'s life, he was saved by his friends. Michael Kelly was now established as the audience\\'s favourite star after Bannister, and was given a Benefit Night in 1790 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 by tradition, he could choose whatever piece he believed would bring in the best receipts at the box-office. At this period a \"programme\" at Drury Lane would always be a double-bill \\xe2\\x80\\x93 a main work, and a one-act \"afterpiece\" which was usually a comedy. Kelly broke with tradition and risked his income by announcing \\xe2\\x80\\x93 to Sheridan\\'s disapproval \\xe2\\x80\\x93 that instead of a popular favourite, he would premiere a new afterpiece by Storace, called No song, no supper. No Song outsold even The Haunted Tower, and proved the best-selling show at Drury Lane for the following decade. Nancy had appeared as a Guest Artist in The Haunted Tower \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the success of No Song obliged Sheridan to take her \"onto the books\", and at last she secured a full-time engagement in Britain._NEWLINE_It seems likely that Storace had been working on an \"English\" version of Vicente Mart\\xc3\\xadn y Soler\\'s (known as Martini) comedy Una cosa rara \\xe2\\x80\\x93 an opera which had already been cited by Mozart in the final scene of Don Giovanni.  However, presumably at around the date of the No Song triumph, Storace abruptly discarded all of Martini\\'s music in Acts II and III, and had librettist James Cobb produce an entirely new libretto, creating another \"romantic\" hit situated in the midst of the Ottoman-Austrian war of a few years earlier, The Siege of Belgrade (1791).  From this point on Storace abandoned the ballad-opera style completely, and wrote the entire piece in the Mozartian \"Singspiel\" style.  The Siege is remarkable for the extended ensemble numbers such as the Act I Trio for the Seraskier, Lilla and Ghita, \"Your passions thus deceiving\" \\xe2\\x80\\x93 divided into allegro-andante-allegro sections.  Alive to what the public cheered most, Storace included a bravura coloratura aria for Mrs Crouch as the imprisoned Austrian hostage, Princess Catherine, \"My plaint in no-one pity moves\"; a warlike Act III aria for Kelly as the \"noble Turk\"; and an extraordinary \"Queen of the Night\"-style dramatic-coloratura Act III aria for Nancy, \"Domestic Peace\", with a string of double-octave fast upward scales to top c\\'\\' over French-horn fanfares that brought the house down. The printed vocal score not only includes one of the famous \"scenery\" engravings, but cast a glove down to the King\\'s Theatre \\xe2\\x80\\x93 avoiding all euphemism the work is clearly described as \"an Opera, in three acts\"._NEWLINE_The year 1792 saw Storace produce the boldest of his operatic projects, Dido, Queen of Carthage, with a libretto by Prince Hoare after Metastasio\\'s Didone abbandonata. This was the only all-sung opera Storace produced in English \\xe2\\x80\\x93 all his other works had spoken dialogue between the musical numbers.  His sister regarded it as Stephen\\'s finest work.  However, for whatever reason, the piece proved unpopular with the public, and was withdrawn after a short run.  The music was not thought worth printing commercially, with the result that not a note of this opera now survives, nor were any solo numbers from it printed separately._NEWLINE_The Pirates, also produced in 1792, was partly adapted from Gli Equivoci, and is remarkable as affording one of the earliest instances of the introduction of a grand finale into an English opera. These works were followed by some less successful productions; but The Cherokee (1794) and The Three and the Deuce (1795) were very favourably received.  The Cherokee did not, unlike The Siege of Belgrade, attempt to add any \"exotic\" music for the Cherokee \\xe2\\x80\\x93 their \"War March\" is disappointingly four-square and tonal, but the \"War Whoop\" is an exciting number.  The work also introduced the public to the boy-treble star, \"Master Walsh\", whose coloratura talents must have been remarkable as his numbers are no less complex than Crouch\\'s or Nancy Storace\\'s.  He was to figure regularly in Storace\\'s works thereafter._NEWLINE_Storace collaborated with Sheridan in bringing William Godwin\\'s controversial novel Caleb Williams to the stage.  In the light of the French Revolution, the work \\xe2\\x80\\x93 about a faithful servant whose life is ruined by a vicious master \\xe2\\x80\\x93 had gained considerable notoriety, and was produced under the title  The Iron Chest, first performed on 12 March 1796._NEWLINE_Storace\\'s final work was Mahmoud, Prince of Persia, but he never saw the premiere.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nDeath\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nHe caught cold at rehearsals for The Iron Chest, and died on 15 or 16 March 1796.  He is buried in Marylebone Parish Church with a monument by the celebrated sculptor Thomas Banks._NEWLINE_Nancy Storace organised that the unfinished work was completed (Kelly claims to have had a hand in doing so, but it is more likely that he paid other hands to do it, since he freely admitted he could not read the bass clef.  Most likely the work was finished and orchestrated by the Orchestra Leader, John Shaw, who was Kelly\\'s collaborator on all his later projects).  The work was given as a Benefit Performance for Storace\\'s widow.  \"Mahmoud\" survives, but it is clear that the completed version was very makeshift._NEWLINE_Storace is also known to have been involved in preparing musical spectaculars for isolated events.  It is intriguing to speculate what performances like The English Fleet in 1391 may have resembled, but no details survive.  He also wrote pieces \"to order\" for favourite performers at the Drury Lane Theatre, such as the musical comedian Richard \"Dicky\" Suett, for whom he wrote the musical farce My Grandmother.  Unfortunately we can only imagine the visual effect of numbers such as \"Dicky\\'s Walk\", which must have accompanied some on-stage buffoonery of a greatly amusing nature.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nLegacy\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nAlthough Storace\\'s works were popular in their time, their failure to endure in performance is in part due to the financial caution of his employer, Sheridan.  A legendarily shrewd man with money, Sheridan refused to allow any copies of the Storace\\'s works to be circulated, for fear of pirate versions being performed from which no royalties would be paid.  In fact history shows that Sheridan\\'s best attempts failed, and pirated versions of Storace\\'s works were playing in New York by the end of the century. However, it is assumed that the carefully guarded scores and parts perished in the Drury Lane Theatre Fire.  Only one opera survives complete in score and parts \\xe2\\x80\\x93 No Song, No Supper (published in Musica Britannica editions, edited by Roger Fiske). The other works survive only in piano and voice vocal scores issued by Storace\\'s publishers, Longman & Broderip.  (A number of these scores were reprinted by Kalmus Edition in the 1970s in the USA, but all have been deleted and no details are available from Kalmus).  The surviving vocal scores have clearly been prepared by an expert hand, and are extensively \"cued\" with the orchestral parts in smaller notes \\xe2\\x80\\x93 it seems possible that Storace himself, or one of his closer assistants, must have prepared these vocal scores.   There are, to date, no commercially available recordings of any of Storace\\'s operas.  Storace is not known to have written any exclusively instrumental music, other than the overtures for his operas._NEWLINE_The character of Storace\\'s music is preeminently English; but his early intercourse with Mozart gave him an immense advantage over his contemporaries in his management of the orchestra, while for the excellence of his writing for the voice he was no doubt indebted to the vocalisation of his sister Ann (Nancy) Storace.'</td>\n",

They lived at Fort Lewis, an antebellum mansion that became a state historic property but was destroyed by fire in the late 1940s._NEWLINE_Payne attended prep school at Mercersburg Academy in Mercersburg, Pennsylvania, and then went to Roanoke College in Salem, Virginia. He then transferred to Columbia University in New York City in the fall of 1930. He studied drama at Columbia and voice at the Juilliard School. To support himself, he took on a variety of odd jobs, including wrestling as \"Alexei Petroff, the Savage of the Steppes\" and boxing as \"Tiger Jack Payne\"._NEWLINE_He returned to his home frequently for visits. In 1942, while visiting his family in Roanoke, Virginia, he agreed to take a small role in a community theatre production of \"The Man Who Came to Dinner\", at the Academy of Music on Salem Avenue. His character uttered only four words of dialogue, and was greeted by a burst of applause.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nStage Actor\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nIn 1934, a talent scout for the Shubert theaters spotted Payne and gave him a job as a stock player. He appeared in road company productions of Rose Marie and The Student Prince at $40 a week._NEWLINE_Payne toured with several Shubert Brothers shows, and frequently sang on New York-based radio programs.  On Broadway he appeared in the revue At Home Abroad (1935\\xe2\\x80\\x9336) alongside Eleanor Powell and Beatrice Lillie. He understudied for Reginald Gardiner and took over one night. He was seen by Fred Kohlmar of Sam Goldwyn\\'s company and was offered a movie contract.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nEarly Films\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nIn 1936, he left New York for Hollywood. He tested for a role in Goldwyn\\'s Come and Get It but lost out to Frank Shields. His first role in Goldwyn\\'s Dodsworth (1936) presented him as an affable, handsome character actor._NEWLINE_He had the male lead in Hats Off (1936), an independent \"B\" film. Goldwyn announced plans to co-star him with Miriam Hopkins in The Woman\\'s Touch, but the film appears to have not been made. In September 1936, it was announced Goldwyn would not sell half of Payne\\'s contract to Columbia, and that he might be the lead in Women Can Be Wrong._NEWLINE_Payne was third billed in Fair Warning (1937), a \"B\" at Fox.

The origins of Islam in the country is linked with the development of Islam in the wider West Africa. Islam was first documented in Central Sudan by medieval Islamic historians and geographers such as Al-Bakri, Yaqut al-Hamawi and Al-Maqrizi and later works of Ibn Battuta and Ibn Khaldun offered more notes about Islam in West Africa._NEWLINE_Islam grew in North-Est Nigeria, in particular the Kanem empire as a result of trade between Kanem and Northern African regions of Fezzan, Egypt and Cyrenaica in the eleventh century. Muslim merchants from the North sometimes remained in settlements along trade routes, this merchant class would later preach the message of Islam to their host communities. The first documented conversion of a traditional ruler was in the eleventh century, when Mai Ume Jilmi of Kanem was converted by a Muslim scholar whose descendants later held an hereditary title of Chief Imam of Kanem._NEWLINE_Writings by Ahmad Fartua an Imam during the period of Idris Alooma provided glimpse of an active Islamic community in Bornu while religious archives showed Islam had been adopted as the religion of the majority of the leading figures in the Borno Empire during the reign of Mai (king) Idris Alooma (1571\\xe2\\x80\\x931603), although a large part of that country still adhered to traditional religions. Alooma furthered the cause of Islam in the country by introducing Islamic courts, establishing mosques, and setting up a hostel in Makkah, the Islamic pilgrimage destination, for Kanuris._NEWLINE_In Hausaland, particularly Kano, Islam is noted to have penetrated the territory in the fourteenth century from West African traders who were converted by Tukulor Muslims from the Senegalese basin and Muslim traders from Mali Empire. Muhammed Rumfa (1463 - 1499) was the first ruler to convert to Islam in Hausaland. It had spread to the major cities of the northern part of the country by the 16th century, later moving into the countryside and towards the Middle Belt uplands. However, there are some claims for an earlier arrival. The Nigeria-born Muslim scholar Sheikh Dr. Abu-Abdullah Abdul-Fattah Adelabu has argued that Islam had reached Sub-Sahara Africa, including Nigeria, as early as the 1st century of Hijrah through Muslim traders and expeditions during the reign of the Arab conqueror, Uqba ibn al Nafia (622\\xe2\\x80\\x93683), whose Islamic conquests under the Umayyad dynasty, during Muawiyah's and Yazid's time, spread all Northern Africa or the Maghrib Al-Arabi, which includes present-day Algeria, Tunisia, Libya and Morocco.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nFulani War\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nIn the early 19th century, Islamic scholar Usman dan Fodio launched a jihad, which is called the Fulani War, against the Hausa Kingdoms of Northern Nigeria. He was victorious, and established the Fulani Empire with its capital at Sokoto.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nMaitatsine\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nA fringe and heretical group, led by the cleric Mohammed Marwa Maitatsine, started in Kano in the late 1970s and operated throughout the 1980s. Maitatsine (since deceased) was from Cameroon, and claimed to have had divine revelations superseding those of the Prophet Muhammad. With their own mosques and a doctrine antagonistic to established Islamic and societal leadership, its main appeal was to marginal and poverty-stricken urban in-migrants, whose rejection by the more established urban groups fostered this religious opposition. These disaffected adherents ultimately lashed out at the more traditional mosques and congregations, resulting in violent outbreaks in several cities of the north.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nQuranists\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nNon-sectarian Muslims who reject the authority of hadith, known as Quranists, Quraniyoon, or 'Yan Kala Kato, are also present in Nigeria. 'Yan Kala Kato is often mistaken for a militant group called Yan Tatsine (also known as Maitatsine), an unrelated group founded by Muhammadu Marwa. Marwa was killed in 1980. Marwa's successor, Musa Makaniki, was arrested in 2004 and sentenced in 2006, but later released. And another leader of Yan Tatsine, Malam Badamasi, was killed in 2009. Notable Nigerian Quranists include Islamic scholars Mallam Saleh Idris Bello, Malam Isiyaka Salisu, and Nigerian High Court Judge Isa Othman.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nSharia law\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nIn 2008, twelve states located in northern Nigeria had fully implemented Sharia law. The twelve states in northern Nigeria have populations where Muslims form the majority._NEWLINE_In 2014, homosexual men were targeted by Hisbah, the religious police. According to a member of the Sharia Commission, homosexuals should be killed by stoning, hanging or pushing them from a high place. In Nigeria, federal law criminalizes homosexual behaviour, but states with Sharia law imposed the death penalty.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nInfluence on culture\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nHistorically, Islam fostered trade relations between North Africa and West Africa. Arabic traders from Tiaret during the Rustamid dynasty were involved in commerce with Audoghast. This trade routes went further south into the Kanuri and Hausa states of Northern Nigeria. Sharia was also introduced into Northern Nigeria has Islam spread across the region. In addition to law and trade, Islam had some influence in spreading the choice of dressing, language and choice of names._NEWLINE_Agbada dressing in West Africa is commonly associated with Muslims and Mallams, Iborun (neck covers) is worn by many Muslims in Southern Nigeria during prayers and crochet hats were once mostly worn by Muslims to had performed the pilgrimage. Some Hausa and Yoruba expressions and words are also influenced by Arabic, the language of the Koran. Assalam Alaykun is a familiar expression for greeting by Muslims and Allahu Akbar is used as a call to prayer. Names such as Mohammed, Ibrahim, Yunusa, Lamidi, Aliu and Suleiman are commonly given to Muslim children.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nTraditional Islamic education\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nBefore the 1950s, the most common educational path of Muslim children in Northern Nigeria was Koranic education taught by Mallams. Students converge in the compound of a mallam or at a Koranic boarding school where they recite the Koran and learn Islamic teachings. The teacher or Mallam as they are sometimes called in Nigeria was likely a graduate of a similar school and likely belongs to a sufi order. These teachers were well versed in Arabic and were influenced by the knowledge and traditions passed down from medieval Timbuktu and from other West African Islamic texts.  Traditional Islamic teaching was considered a duty to God and teachers sometimes depended on charity or patrons to make ends meet. Meanwhile,  students also assist teachers in raising funds through door-to-door solicitations. In the period preceding Nigeria's independence, political leaders desired Western-trained graduates to fill positions in government. Subsequently, the introduction of a formal School of Arabic Studies in Kano to train Qadis and rise in Western education reduced the number of children attending the Koranic schools. In addition, Islamic studies was introduced into the primary and secondary school curriculum.  However, some parents still send their children to the traditional Koranic schools under the tutelage of a mallam. The students are provided shelter by their teacher. The pre-adolescents sometimes subsist through alms begging or house-help jobs, while those above fifteen learn a trade or do petty trading along with their Islamic studies. The studies can be rigorous, with students studying the Koran for fourteen hours per day until they reach a set level of maturity. These students, primarily from rural areas, are called Almajiri\\xe2\\x80\\x94a transliteration of Al Muhajirun, the Arabic word for emigrant\\xe2\\x80\\x94in Nigeria. They are sometimes looked down upon by Western-educated Muslims who are uncomfortable with the alms begging lifestyle of many Almajiri.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nExtremism\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nIn Nigeria, Pew Research polled the views of Muslims on extremist groups. 45% favoured Hezbollah, 49% favoured Hamas and 49% favoured Al-Qaeda. Unlike Turkey, Egypt, Jordan and Indonesia, Nigeria was the only country where Muslims were positive towards Al-Qaeda.\"</td>\n",

There are many interpretations of the story, but he is variously thought to portend the death of a member of the Ogilvy family, Earl of Airlie or the owners of Cortachy Castle. He is said to be nine foot tall and is occasionally accompanied by ghostly pipes. The legend can trace its roots back to at least the 19th century and the death of the 14th Earl of Airlie. He is said to play a tattoo when he appears._NEWLINE_The ghost is thought to be the spirit of a drummer for the Carlisle family; who was thrown out of a window in the high tower of the castle after incurring the jealousy of the then Lord. However, some versions of the story say that the drummer was the messenger for a hated chieftain and in yet another version of the tale, he is the spirit of a drummer who deliberately failed to warn the castle of an impending attack. In all versions of the tale he was stuffed into his drum before his death._NEWLINE_The most famous sighting of the drummer was in 1844, when the Lady Airlie (or in some versions, her guests) heard the noise. She would later write in a note on her deathbed that she 'knew the drumming was for [her]'._NEWLINE_The spirit is now thought to be dormant since in 1900 the Earl of Airlie died in the Boer War without a reported sighting.\"</td>\n",

A proconsul was typically a former consul. The term is also used in recent history for officials with delegated authority._NEWLINE_In the Roman Republic, military command, or imperium, could be exercised constitutionally only by a consul. There were two consuls at a time, each elected to a one-year term. They could not normally serve two terms in a row. If a military campaign was in progress at the end of a consul\\'s term, the consul in command might be appointed as proconsul by the Senate when his term expired. This custom allowed for continuity of command despite the high turnover of consuls. In the Roman Empire, proconsul was a title held by a civil governor and did not imply military command._NEWLINE_In modern times, various officials with notable delegated authority have been referred to as proconsuls. Studies of leadership typically divide leaders into policymakers and subordinate administrators. The proconsul occupies a position between these two categories. Max Weber classified leadership as traditional, rational-legal (bureaucratic), and charismatic. A proconsul could be both a rule-following bureaucrat and charismatic personality. The rise of bureaucracy and rapid communication has reduced the scope for proconsular freelancing.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nEtymology\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nThe Latin word pr\\xc5\\x8dconsul is a shortened form of pr\\xc5\\x8d consule, meaning \"(one acting) for the consul.\" It appears on inscriptions beginning in 135 BC. Ancient historians describe Quintus Publilius Philo, the first proconsul, as pr\\xc5\\x8d consule for 326 BC. For later proconsuls, the same sources use the shortened form.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nIn leadership theory\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nAlthough \"proconsul\" is an official title only with respect to magistrates of ancient Rome, the word has also been applied to various British, U.S., and French officials. In the modern context, it is rarely a compliment. The terms satrap (from Persian) and viceroy (from French) are both used in a similar way._NEWLINE_Despite the gulf between ancient and modern proconsuls, writer Carnes Lord has proposed a single definition to allow the phenomenon to be analyzed in the context of leadership theory: \"delegated political-military leadership that rises in the best case to statesmanship\". South African historian John Benyon defines a proconsul as a leader with \"semi-independent and extraordinary capacity to shape the periphery\" of an empire._NEWLINE_Modern writing on leadership tends to stress the distinction between \"administration\" on the one hand and \"policy\" on the other. This emphasis can be traced to an essay by Woodrow Wilson written in the late 19th century. In earlier epochs, it was common for leaders to combine the two roles. Since this is no longer the case, specific terminology is required to describe such officials._NEWLINE_In his classic study, Max Weber distinguished among three modes of legitimate governance: traditional, rational-legal, and charismatic. In the form of bureaucracy, the rational-legal mode is dominant in the modern world. But a modern proconsul may also resort to aristocratic, or charismatic, leadership._NEWLINE_In the Roman Republic, a proconsul was typically a former consul and thus an experienced commander-in-chief. Having held the Republic\\'s highest office, he was a statesman as well as an administrator. Rome\\'s patrician class was prepared to exercise aristocratic leadership, both civil and military._NEWLINE_Several factors are said to limit the scope of proconsular authority in modern times. Democracies put the military under civilian authority and tend to avoid policymaking by military leaders. Modern government emphasizes bureaucracy and rulemaking, while the Romans were aristocratic. Finally, modern communications allows for greater central control._NEWLINE_Although transoceanic telegraph lines were laid by the mid-19th century, Lord describes the late 19th century as the heyday of British proconsular authority. Lord Curzon in India, Frederick Lugard in Nigeria, Cecil Rhodes in South Africa, and Cromer in Egypt all took imperial initiatives that London approved only reluctantly. As ruler of Japan and Korea after World War II, U.S. General Douglas MacArthur consciously modeled himself on a Roman aristocrat._NEWLINE_The role of U.S. General David Petraeus and others in Iraq suggests a continued need for proconsular leadership, according to Lord. Modern technology makes communication easier than ever. But as email and Power Point presentations proliferate, clarity and intellectual discipline is lost. Another factor is that civilian policymakers, whether on the spot or in the metropole, may lack the skills needed to manage military forces. Yet proconsuls are at best an ad hoc solution to a reoccurring problem. Managing a large territory in occupation or conflict requires a range of skills and the ability to deal with various organizations. No one is trained as a proconsul and the available administrators have experience in at most one relevant agency or service. During the Vietnam War, the U.S. attempted to deal with this issue by creating an integrated civilian-military command structure called Civil Operations and Revolutionary Development Support (CORDS).\\n_START_SECTION_\\nBritish Empire\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nBritish colonial officials sometimes referred to as proconsuls include Alfred Milner in South Africa, Lord Curzon in India, Lord Lugard in Nigeria, and Lord Kitchener in Egypt and Sudan. These leaders were able to take imperial initiatives even when the government in London was reluctant. Conservative and Unionist governments were notably more tolerant of such freelancing than Liberal governments were. These proconsuls ruled in the age of the transoceanic telegraph, so rapid communication did not end proconsular independence.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nUnited States\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nVarious American commanders and ambassadors have been referred to as proconsuls.

A scholarly edition called The Journeys of Celia Fiennes was produced by Christopher Morris in 1947, and since then the book has been in print in a variety of editions. _NEWLINE_Fiennes was interested in anything new, in innovations, bustling towns, the newly fashionable spa towns such as Bath and Harrogate, and in commerce. Fiennes\\'s patriotic justification for domestic tourism and her interest in the \"production and manufactures of each place\" anticipated the genre of \"economic tourism\" which became formalised with Daniel Defoe\\'s professional and survey-like A Tour through the Whole Island of Great Britain (1724\\xe2\\x80\\x9326). The economic tourist would become a staple of travel writing throughout the 18th and 19th centuries._NEWLINE_Fiennes saw many of the finest baroque English country houses while they were still under construction. Contrary to the widespread conception that the visiting of \"stately homes\" began after the Second World War, they have been accessible to travellers of good social standing since Fiennes\\' time if not earlier, and her comments are one of the most interesting contemporary sources of information about them. At Stonehenge she counted the exact number of stones, and at Harrogate visited \"the sulphur or stinking spaw\". She also clambered over the rocks at Land\\'s End.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nRemembered\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nCelia Fiennes died in Hackney in 1741. Her travels are the subject of a play, Riding England Sidesaddle by Christopher Goulding, which premi\\xc3\\xa8red at the People\\'s Theatre, Newcastle upon Tyne in 1992, starring Andrea Riseborough as the young Celia Fiennes.'</td>\n",

Clotiazepam is also used as a premedicant in minor surgery in France and Japan, where the drug is commercially available under the brand names Veratran and Rize, respectively.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nPharmacokinetics\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nA cross-over study in six healthy volunteers (median age 28 years) was conducted using single-dose pharmacokinetics of 5\\xc2\\xa0mg clotiazepam drops, oral tablets, and sublingual tablets. The formulations had similar systemic availability. Compared with oral tablets, the sublingual route gave a lower peak concentration and a delayed peak time, while drops gave a greater maximum concentration with a similar peak time. The use of drops is suggested for a more marked initial effect and the sublingual route for easier administration, especially in the elderly.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nPharmacology\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nSimilar to other benzodiazepines clotiazepam has anxiolytic, sedative, hypnotic, amnesic, anticonvulsant and muscle relaxant pharmacological properties. Clotiazepam binds to the benzodiazepine site of the GABAA receptor where it acts as a full agonist; this action results in an enhanced GABA inhibitory effect at the GABAA receptor which results in the pharmacological effects of clotiazepam._NEWLINE_Clotiazepam has a relatively short elimination half-life and is less prone to accumulation after repeated dosing compared to longer-acting benzodiazepine agents. It is metabolised via oxidation. Clotiazepam is metabolised to hydroxy-clotiazepam and desmethyl-clotiazepam. After oral ingestion of a single 5\\xc2\\xa0mg dose of clotiazepam by three healthy volunteers the drug was rapidly absorbed. The elimination half-life of the drug and its metabolites range from 6.5 hours to 18 hours. Clotiazepam is 99 percent bound to plasma protein. In elderly men the elimination half-life is longer and in elderly women the volume of distribution is increased. Individuals with liver impairment have a reduced volume of distribution as well as a reduced total clearance of clotiazepam; renal impairment does not affect the kinetics of clotiazepam.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nSide effects\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nDrowsiness and asthenia are common side effects. There has been a report of hepatitis caused by clotiazepam.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nAbuse\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nClotiazepam is a recognised drug of abuse.'</td>\n",

The majority of the Newfoundland Railway's operations were not economically self-sustaining, requiring significant subsidization; however, it was only after the construction of the Trans-Canada Highway across the island in the early 1960s that the railway began to see serious declines in traffic._NEWLINE_At the same time, CN took over the Newfoundland Railway's ferry service between North Sydney, Nova Scotia and Port aux Basques, Newfoundland and promptly began to improve the service, bringing in vessels dedicated to carrying automobiles and trucks throughout the 1950s-1970s._NEWLINE_By the early 1970s, CN faced increased scrutiny from federal politicians complaining about the railway's continuous losses. Successive federal governments of the period had frequently forced the company to undertake various endeavours in the national interest, often at the expense of business and economic logic.  As a result, CN sought to restructure itself, placing many of these operations into separate subsidiaries to clarify the accounting behind their existence.  Restructuring applied to operations which lost money and required subsidization, or which were not part of CN's core freight railway business._NEWLINE_In 1977, all east coast ferries operated by CN were transferred to a new CN Subsidiary, CN Marine.  Passenger rail services were transferred to the new Crown corporation, Via Rail, and in 1979, all of CN's freight railway operations on Newfoundland, along with the CN Roadcruiser Bus service and CN's trucking operation, were placed into a new division named Terra Transport.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nCN on Newfoundland\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nCN's operations on Newfoundland revolved around the former Newfoundland Railway, which was the longest 3\\xc2\\xa0ft\\xc2\\xa06\\xc2\\xa0in (1,067\\xc2\\xa0mm) narrow-gauge railway in North America, stretching approximately 1000\\xc2\\xa0km across the island, from the ferry terminal in Port aux Basques to the provincial capital at St. John's. Many of the island's largest communities developed along the main line, largely because of their location; as a result, the Trans-Canada Highway paralleled its route in many places._NEWLINE_Rail operations in Newfoundland remained economically unfeasible because of slow service times, a side effect of the narrow-gauge format. CN invested heavily in track improvements during the 1950s-1960s, but the narrow-gauge operation could not compete with the flexibility of trucks.  Significant time was lost at Port aux Basques, where standard-gauge railway cars from mainland North America were lifted off their bogies and onto narrow-gauge bogies for use on Newfoundland. In some cases this was not possible, and the rail car contents were unloaded and reloaded onto narrow-gauge cars. CN's operation of dedicated railway car ferries was an additional expense._NEWLINE_CN operated a main line passenger train, the Caribou, from St. John's to Port aux Basques.  Nicknamed the Newfie Bullet, the Caribou operated until June 1969, when it was replaced by the CN Roadcruiser bus service started in the Fall of 1968. With the demise of the Caribou, the only passenger services remaining on the island were mixed freight and passenger trains on the Bonavista, Carbonear, and Argentia branch lines, and on the main-line between Bishop's Falls and Corner Brook. Terra Transport would continue to operate mixed passenger/freight service on the branch lines until 1984. The mainline service between Corner Brook and Bishop's Falls made its last run on 30 September 1988. The Roadcruiser bus service ran until 29 March 1996, when it was sold to DRL Coachlines of Triton, Newfoundland._NEWLINE_The most significant change made under the Terra Transport subsidiary was the move to the carriage of less-than-carload (LCL) freight. A large fleet of distinctive green intermodal shipping containers were ordered and used in place of boxcars.  These containers were stacked on flatcars of mainland trains, fitted onto the decks inside the ferries, and then placed on flatcars of trains in Newfoundland, or transported entirely by truck. During the mid-1980s, trains composed almost entirely of the distinctive TT containers were common. The handling time for freight dropped considerably, as containers could be easily removed from the trains in each community and the loading/unloading at Port aux Basques 3\\xc2\\xa0ft\\xc2\\xa06\\xc2\\xa0in (1,067\\xc2\\xa0mm) was significantly improved over standard freight cars. Another significant change the closure and abandonment all of CN's branch lines in the province by 1984, leaving only the main line operational._NEWLINE_Despite these changes, Terra Transport was unable to turn a profit for CN and the federal government. Specialized ferries were still needed for carrying non-LCL railway cars, and by the mid-1980s were approaching the end of their operational life and required replacement. The election of a Conservative federal government brought about the elimination of subsidies for money-losing operations. In 1986, one of two remaining railcar ferries was sold off as the government converted CN Marine into Marine Atlantic, completely separating the rail and ferry services. Terra Transport operations were largely captive on Newfoundland and would specialize in handling import/export LCL and inter-island non-LCL freight.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nAbandonment\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nIn 1987, the federal government deregulated the railway industry in Canada and CN promptly applied to abandon its Newfoundland operations under Terra Transport. The political firestorm which followed saw the federal and provincial governments negotiate a one-time payout of $800 million (CAD) from Ottawa to St. John's to fund highway improvements under the Trans-Canada Highway Program and the Regional Trunk Road Agreement._NEWLINE_The agreements were signed in December 1987; however, continuing public outcry and legal challenges kept the railway operational for several months.  On 20 June 1988, it was officially announced that the railway would cease operations as of 1 September 1988. Some freight trains still ran until late September, with the last scheduled run on 29 September 1988. The last scheduled passenger train ran on 30 September 1988, from Bishops Falls to Corner Brook. Following official abandonment, the railway operated salvage trains, dismantling track in remote locations; some salvage trains were still operating in the summer of 1990.  Most of the track was removed and scrapped by November 1990. CN no longer has any operations in the Province of Newfoundland. In the fall of 1996 CN contracted out its intermodal trucking operation to Clarke Transport, which is now the local agent for CN._NEWLINE_Since 1997, the old railbed has been reclaimed as the Newfoundland T'Railway Provincial Park.\"</td>\n",

After his father had been reassigned to Canada, his mother and Dallaire immigrated to Canada when the boy was six months old, traveling on the Empire Brent. They landed in Halifax on December 13, 1946. The family lived in Montreal during Dallaire\\'s childhood._NEWLINE_He enrolled in the Canadian Army in 1963, as a cadet at Le Coll\\xc3\\xa8ge militaire royal de Saint-Jean. In 1970 he graduated from the Royal Military College of Canada with a Bachelor of Science degree and was commissioned into The Royal Regiment of Canadian Artillery._NEWLINE_In 1971, Dallaire applied for a Canadian passport to travel overseas with his troops. He was surprised to learn that his birth as the son of a Canadian soldier, although in the Netherlands, did not give him automatic Canadian citizenship. He has subsequently become a Canadian citizen._NEWLINE_Dallaire also attended the Canadian Land Force Command and Staff College, the United States Marine Corps Command and Staff College in Quantico, Virginia, and the British Higher Command and Staff Course._NEWLINE_He commanded the 5\\xe1\\xb5\\x89 R\\xc3\\xa9giment d\\'artillerie l\\xc3\\xa9g\\xc3\\xa8re du Canada. On July 3, 1989, he was promoted to the rank of brigadier-general. He commanded the 5 Canadian Mechanized Brigade Group. He was also the commandant of Coll\\xc3\\xa8ge militaire royal de Saint-Jean from 1989 to 1991.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nOriginal mission\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nIn late 1993, Dallaire received his commission as the Major-General of UNAMIR, the United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda. UNAMIR\\'s goal was to assist in the implementation of the Arusha Accords, a peace agreement intended to end the Rwandan Civil War. The UN attempted to negotiate with the Hutus in the Rwandan army and with Juv\\xc3\\xa9nal Habyarimana, a Hutu who was president at the time, and with the Tutsis, as represented by the rebel commander Paul Kagame, who led the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF). (He later was elected as President of Rwanda as of September 2017.) When Dallaire arrived in Rwanda, his mandate was to supervise the implementation of the accords during a transitional period in which Tutsis were to be given some positions of power within the Hutu-dominated government._NEWLINE_There were early signs that something was amiss when, on January 22, 1994, a French DC-8 aircraft landed in Kigali, the capital of Rwanda, loaded with ammunition and weapons for the Rwandan Armed Forces (FAR). (FAR was the Hutu army under Habyarimana\\'s control.) Dallaire notified the UN by fax, suggesting he seize these weapons to prevent violence, but the UN deemed this action to be beyond his UN mandate. In addition to the arms deliveries, he learned that troops from the Rwandan government began checking identity cards, which identified individuals by ethnicity as Hutu or Tutsi.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nGenocide\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nOn 11 January 1994, General Rom\\xc3\\xa9o Dallaire, commander of UNAMIR, sent his \"Genocide Fax\" to UN Headquarters. The fax stated that Dallaire was in contact with \"a top level trainer in the cadre of Interhamwe-armed [sic] militia of MRND.\" The informant claimed to have been ordered to register all Tutsi in Kigali. According to the memo, the informant suspected that a genocide against the Tutsis was being planned, and he said that \"in 20 minutes his personnel could kill up to 1000 Tutsis\". Dallaire\\'s request to protect the informant and his family and to raid the weapons caches he revealed was denied by the UN._NEWLINE_The result was a genocide of between 500,000 and 1,000,000. Seven out of every 10 Tutsis were killed._NEWLINE_UNAMIR commander Rom\\xc3\\xa9o Dallaire learned of the Hutu Power movement during the mission\\'s deployment, as well as plans for the mass extermination of Tutsi. He also became aware of secret weapons caches through an informant, but his request to raid them was turned down by the UN Department of Peacekeeping Operations (DPKO), which felt that Dallaire was exceeding his mandate and had to be kept \"on a leash\". Seizing the weapons was argued to be squarely within UNAMIR\\'s mandate; both sides had requested UNAMIR and it had been authorized by the UN Security Council in Resolution 872._NEWLINE_UNAMIR\\'s effectiveness in peacekeeping was also hampered by President Habyarimana and Hutu hardliners, and by April 1994, the Security Council threatened to terminate UNAMIR\\'s mandate if it did not make progress._NEWLINE_Following the death of Habyarimana, and the start of the genocide, Dallaire liaised repeatedly with both the Crisis Committee and the RPF, attempting to re-establish peace and prevent the resumption of the civil war. Neither side was interested in a ceasefire, the government because it was controlled by the genocidaires, and the RPF because it considered it necessary to fight to stop the killings. UNAMIR\\'s Chapter VI mandate rendered it powerless to intervene militarily, and most of its Rwandan staff were killed in the early days of the genocide, severely limiting its ability to operate._NEWLINE_UNAMIR was therefore largely reduced to a bystander role, and Dallaire later labelled it a \"failure\". Its most significant contribution was to provide refuge for thousands of Tutsi and moderate Hutu at its headquarters in Amahoro Stadium, as well as other secure UN sites, and to assist with the evacuation of foreign nationals. On 12 April, the Belgian government, which was one of the largest troop contributors to UNAMIR, and had lost ten soldiers protecting Prime Minister Uwilingiliyimana, announced that it was withdrawing, reducing the force\\'s effectiveness even further.  _NEWLINE_Dallaire was later on severely criticized by the Belgian parliamentary commission for his role leading to the torture and murder of ten members of the 2nd Commando Battalion and their protected charge. While Lieutenant Lotin and his men were being tortured and murdered, General Dallaire passed by at 60 metres. Seeing the Belgium soldiers General Dallaire did not intervene. In his answer to the martial council he would later say \"I did not know whether they were dead or injured.\" He went on to meet officers of the Rwanda army at the Military School, but did not mention the event. The company of the Bangladeshi Battalion which had the task of Quick Reaction Force was ill prepared and did not leave their barracks. After those events Belgium withdrew its forces from Rwanda. Dallaire considered them to be his best-trained and best-equipped forces. The commission of inquiry of the Belgian Senate in 1998 severely condemned Dallaire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s actions during those days. According to the parliamentary commission Dallaire adopted an overly reserved attitude in the months before the genocide undermining the credibility of UNAMIR in the eyes of the Rwandans. Furthermore Dallaire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s actions were considered to be \\xe2\\x80\\x9cimprudent and unprofessional to have the Belgian escorts provided on 7 April with so few military precautions\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. In addition, the commission stated it \"did not understand why general Dallaire, who had noted the blue beret bodies in the Kigali camp, did not communicate this immediately to the FAR\\'S high-ranking officers at the meeting of the \\xc3\\x89cole sup\\xc3\\xa9rieure and did not demand the urgent intervention of those Rwandan officers present. This appears to reflect considerable indifference on his part. Moreover, general Dallaire also neglected to inform his sector commander about what he had seen and to give the necessary instructions\"._NEWLINE_On 17 May 1994, the UN passed Resolution 918, which imposed an arms embargo and reinforced UNAMIR, which would be known as UNAMIR II.  The new soldiers did not start arriving until June, and following the end of the genocide in July, the role of UNAMIR II was largely confined to maintaining security and stability, until its termination in 1996._NEWLINE_Several individuals attempted to halt the Rwandan genocide, or to shelter vulnerable Tutsi. Among them were Rom\\xc3\\xa9o Dallaire (Canadian Lieutenant-General of UNAMIR), Henry Kwami Anyidoho (Ghanaian Deputy Commander of UNAMIR), Pierantonio Costa (Italian diplomat who rescued many lives), Antonia Locatelli (Italian volunteer who in 1992, two years before the actual genocide, tried to save 300 or 400 Tutsis by calling officials in the international community and was later murdered by the Interahamwe), Jacqueline Mukansonera (Hutu woman who saved a Tutsi during the genocide), Zura Karuhimbi (Hutu elderly widow who sheltered more than 100 refugees in her village home, posing as a witch to repel and frighten militiamen), Paul Rusesabagina (the Academy Award nominated film Hotel Rwanda is based on his story), Carl Wilkens (the only American who chose to remain in Rwanda during the genocide), Andr\\xc3\\xa9 Sibomana (Hutu priest and journalist who saved many lives) and Captain Mbaye Diagne (Senegalese army officer of UNAMIR who saved many lives before he was killed)._NEWLINE_Dallaire gave the major force contributors different evaluations for their work. In his book, he gave the Tunisian and Ghanaian contingents high praise for their valiant and competent work.  Three of Ghana\\'s peacekeepers died in the warfare.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nEnd to the genocide\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nAs the massacre progressed and the press covered the genocide more widely, the U.N. Security Council backtracked and voted to establish UNAMIR II, with a strength of 5,500 men, in response to the French plan to occupy portions of the country. (Dallaire initially opposed the so-called French Op\\xc3\\xa9ration Turquoise, because the French had a history of backing the Hutus and the Rwandan Armed Forces. He believed their presence would be opposed by Kagame and the rebel Rwandan Patriotic Front). It was not until early July, when RPF troops under Kagame swept into Kigali, that the genocide ended. By August, the French had handed their portion of the country to the RPF, giving Kagame effective control of all of Rwanda._NEWLINE_Testimony at the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda demonstrated that the genocide was brutally efficient, lasting for a total of 100 days and leading to the murder of 800,000 Tutsi, Hutu moderates and Twa. More than two million people were displaced internally or in neighbouring countries. The genocide ended when the Rwandan Patriotic Front gained control of Rwanda on July 18, 1994. But political unrest and violence have continued, with recrimination and retribution. The government continues to conduct criminal prosecutions in the war.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nLife after Rwanda\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nUpon his return to Canada from UNOMUR and UNAMIR, Dallaire was appointed to two simultaneous commands in September 1994: Deputy Commander of Land Force Command (LFC) in Saint-Hubert, Quebec and Commander of 1 Canadian Division. In October 1995, Dallaire assumed command of Land Force Quebec Area._NEWLINE_In 1996, Dallaire was promoted to Chief of Staff and to the Assistant Deputy Minister (Personnel) Group at NDHQ. In 1998, he was assigned to Assistant Deputy Minister (Human Resources \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Military) and in 1999 was appointed Special Advisor to the Chief of the Defence Staff on Officer Professional Development._NEWLINE_Dallaire suffered from posttraumatic stress disorder and in 2000, attempted suicide by combining alcohol with his anti-depressant medication, a near fatal combination which left him comatose. _NEWLINE_Dallaire is an outspoken supporter of raising awareness for veterans\\' mental health._NEWLINE_In January 2004, Dallaire appeared at the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda to testify against Colonel Th\\xc3\\xa9oneste Bagosora. (The testimony was critical to the outcome of the trial and in December 2008 Bagosora was convicted of genocide and for the command responsibility of the murders of the 10 Belgian Peacekeepers. The trial chamber held that: \"it is clear that the killing of the peacekeepers formed part of the widespread and systematic attack\", while at the same time holding that: \"the evidence suggests that these killings were not necessarily part of a highly coordinated plan.\") He later worked as a Special Advisor to the Canadian Government on War Affected Children and the Prohibition of Small Arms Distribution, as well as with international agencies with the same focus, including child labour. In 2004\\xe2\\x80\\x932005, he served as a fellow at the Carr Center For Human Rights Policy at Harvard University\\'s John F. Kennedy School of Government.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nAppointment to Canadian Senate\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nOn March 24, 2005, Dallaire was appointed to the Senate of Canada by Governor General Adrienne Clarkson on the advice of Prime Minister Paul Martin. He represented the province of Quebec and sat as a Liberal until January 29, 2014, when he along with all of his Liberal Senate peers were removed from the party caucus by party leader Justin Trudeau, after which he officially sat as an Independent Liberal. Dallaire noted that his family has supported both the Liberal Party of Canada and the Quebec Liberal Party since 1958. He supported Michael Ignatieff\\'s unsuccessful 2006 bid for the leadership of the federal Liberal Party._NEWLINE_In 2007, Dallaire called for the reopening of Coll\\xc3\\xa8ge militaire royal de Saint-Jean, saying \"The possibility of starting a new program at the college \\xe2\\x80\\x93 a military college that would allow all officer cadets to spend two years in Saint-Jean before going to Kingston, instead of studying only in Kingston \\xe2\\x80\\x93 is being considered. In the spirit of progress, would it be possible to support a principle as basic as the freedom of francophones in the Canadian Armed Forces by establishing a CEGEP-style francophone bilingual military college.\"_NEWLINE_Concordia University announced on September 8, 2006, that Dallaire would sit as Senior Fellow at the Montreal Institute for Genocide and Human Rights Studies (MIGS), a research centre based at the university\\'s Faculty of Arts & Science. Later that month, on September 29, 2006, he issued a statement urging the international community to be prepared to defend Bah\\xc3\\xa1\\'\\xc3\\xads in Iran from possible atrocities._NEWLINE_Dallaire has worked to bring understanding of post-traumatic stress disorder to the general public. His 2016 book, Waiting for First Light: My Ongoing Battle with PTSD, details his own struggles with this operational stress injury.  He has been a visiting lecturer at several Canadian and American universities. He was a Fellow of the Carr Center for Human Rights Policy, Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University. He pursued research on conflict resolution and the use of child soldiers.  He published the book, They Fight Like Soldiers, They Die Like Children: the Global Quest to Eradicate the Use of Child Soldiers in 2010.

Early in Dallaire\\'s post military career he was tasked by the Department of National Defense (DND), to create a program that will support the rehabilitation needs of former military personnel._NEWLINE_Dallaire is a supporter of the Campaign for the Establishment of a United Nations Parliamentary Assembly, an organisation which advocates for democratic reformation of the United Nations._NEWLINE_On December 3, 2013, Dallaire was in a car accident on Parliament Hill, Ottawa. His car, a black BMW, hit a lamp post before it was stopped. Dallaire said he had fallen asleep at the wheel due to stress. His vehicle\\'s air bag deployed and there were no casualties._NEWLINE_Dallaire resigned from the Senate on June 17, 2014, seven years prior to reaching mandatory retirement. He decided to leave the Senate in order to spend more time public speaking, to do research on and due to his own struggles with posttraumatic stress disorder, due to his frustration with the ongoing Canadian Senate expenses scandal, and to devote the majority of his time on the issue of eradicating the use of child soldiers through his Rom\\xc3\\xa9o Dallaire Child Soldiers Initiative.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nBooks\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nDallaire has written three books.

The founder\\'s charter shows the name of the abbey as \"the church of St Mary of Edwardstow\", or the Latin \"Ecclesia Sanctae Mariae de loco Sancti Edwardi\" although the title of the charter calls it \"Letley\"; the present name of Netley is most likely derived from this. The abbey was one of a pair of monasteries which the bishop intended as a memorial to himself; the other is La Clart\\xc3\\xa9-Dieu in Saint-Paterne-Racan, France. Des Roches began to purchase the lands for Netley\\'s initial endowment in about 1236, but he died before the project was finished and the foundation was completed by his executors. According to the Chronicle of Waverley Abbey, the first monks arrived to settle the site on 25\\xc2\\xa0July 1239 from neighbouring Beaulieu Abbey, a year after the bishop\\'s death. The fact of its founder prior death before designation of the endowment was complete, put the incipient abbey in a difficult financial situation. It is thought that only after the house was taken under the wing of Henry III, who became interested in it in the mid-1240s, was progress made on the buildings. The King eventually assumed the role of patron in 1251.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nChurch\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nThe fruits of royal patronage were demonstrated by the construction of a large church (72 metres (236\\xc2\\xa0ft) long), built in the fashionable French-influenced Gothic style pioneered by Henry\\'s masons at Westminster Abbey. The high quality and elaborate nature of the church\\'s decoration, particularly its mouldings and tracery, indicate how the machine of royal patronage lead to a move away from the deliberate austerity of the early Cistercian churches towards the grandeur then considered appropriate to a secular church such as a cathedral. Construction of the church proceeded from east to west. The sanctuary and transepts were built first to allow the monks to hold services, and the nave was completed over time. It is not known precisely when the building work began, but major gifts by King Henry of roofing timber and lead from Derbyshire in 1251 and 1252 indicate that some of the eastern parts of the church, and probably of the east cloister range too, had by then reached an advanced stage. The presence of a foundation stone at the base of the southeast pier of the crossing inscribed \"H. DI. GRA REX ANGE\" (Latin for Henry by the Grace of God King of the English) shows that the foundations of the centre of the church reached ground level after 1251, the year Henry III formally became the abbey\\'s patron. Taking many decades to complete, the church was probably finished between 1290 and 1320. Dating the various parts of the building relies predominantly on stylistic criteria._NEWLINE_The church was cruciform in shape, with vaulting and a square sanctuary and a low central tower containing bells. It was aisled throughout, with a pair of chapels on the east side of each transept. There was no triforium, but a narrow gallery surmounted by a clerestory of triple lancet windows ran above each bay of the arcade, as can be seen in the surviving section in the south transept. The vaulting sprang directly from the top of the arcade. The wall at the eastern end of the sanctuary, probably built after 1260, had a large window which features an upper rose and elaborate tracery; the aisle windows were simple paired lancets recessed within an arch. In the nave, the south aisle had plain triple lancets set high in the wall to avoid the cloister roof. The north aisle windows by contrast had richly decorated cusped tracery, reflecting the changes in taste over the long period of construction, and suggesting that this was among the last parts of the church to be finished, probably in the very late thirteenth or early fourteenth centuries. The west wall of the church also has a large window, the tracery of which was destroyed in a collapse during the eighteenth century. Surviving fragments show that it was built in a \"freer and more advanced style\" than other parts of the church, and suggest a date around the turn of the fourteenth century._NEWLINE_Internally, the church was subdivided into several areas. The high altar was against the east wall of the sanctuary, flanked by two smaller altars on the side walls. To the west, under the tower, were the monks\\' choir stalls where they sat during services, and further west was a pulpitum or rood screen, which blocked access to the ritual areas of the church. In the nave, the lay brothers had their own choir stalls and altar for services. The monks of Netley kept up a schedule of services and prayer both day and night following the traditional canonical hours; a staircase in the south transept went up to the monks\\' dormitory, allowing them to convenient access to the night services. The lay brothers had their own entrance to the church at the west end via a covered gallery from their accommodation._NEWLINE_Unlike other orders of monks who allowed parishioners and visitors admission to the nave, the Cistercians officially reserved their churches solely for the use of the monastic community. Others had to worship in a separate chapel in the abbey grounds close to the main gate. Over time this rule was relaxed to allow pilgrims to visit shrines, as at Hailes Abbey with its relic of the Holy Blood, and to allow the construction of tombs and chantries for patrons and wealthy benefactors of the house, as in the churches of other orders. Excavated sculpture shows that the church at Netley featured a number of elaborate tombs and monuments._NEWLINE_The interior of the church was richly decorated. The walls were plastered and painted in white and maroon with geometric patterns and lines designed to give the impression of ashlar masonry. Architectural detail was also picked out in maroon. The floors were covered in polychrome encaustic tiles featuring foliage, heraldic beasts, and coats of arms including those of England, France, the Holy Roman Empire, Queen Eleanor of Castile, Richard of Cornwall and many powerful noble families. The chapels in the south transept had tiles with symbols of Edward the Confessor and the Virgin Mary. The windows of the church were filled with painted glass, six panels of which have been recovered. They show scenes from the life of the Virgin Mary, the Crucifixion, monks, monsters and humorous animals.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nCloister and east range\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nSouth of the church stands a cloister surrounded by ranges of buildings on three sides, the church forming the fourth. As is known, the cloister was the heart of the abbey, where the monks spent most of their time when not in church, engaged in study, copying books and the creation of illuminated manuscripts. The monks\\' desks were placed in the north walk of the cloister, and a cupboard for books in current use was carved into the external wall of the south transept._NEWLINE_The east range, which was started at the same time as the church and probably took about 10 years to build, contained many of the abbey\\'s most important rooms. The vaulted library and sacristy were on the ground floor, adjacent to the church. To the south was the chapter house, where the deliberations of the abbey took place and the monks met to transact business and to listen to a daily reading of a chapter of the Rule of St Benedict. At Netley this was a magnificent apartment divided into three aisles with vaults springing from four columns; a stone bench ran around the walls for the monks to sit on, and the abbot\\'s throne was in the centre of the east wall. The entrance to the chapter house from the cloister is via an elaborately moulded arched doorway, flanked on each side by a window of similar size. The windows had sills and columns of Purbeck Marble, the whole forming an impressive composition appropriate to the second most important space in the abbey after the church. The windows on either side of the door would have been unglazed, so as to allow representatives of the laybrothers (who were not members of chapter) to listen to debates. The chapter house was also the site of some tombs, traditionally those of the abbots of a monastery. When the room was excavated, archaeologists discovered scattered human remains and evidence of graves beneath the medieval floor level, indicating that a number of burials._NEWLINE_The parlour lies south, an austere, barrel vaulted room little more than a passageway through the building. Here the monks could talk without disturbing the silence in the cloister, which Cistercian rules insisted on. South of this runs a long vaulted hall with a central row of pillars supporting the roof. This room was much altered over time and probably served several purposes during the lifetime of the abbey. Initially, it may have served as the monks\\' day room and accommodation for novices, but as time went on it may have been converted into the misericord where the monks\\xe2\\x80\\x94initially only the sick, but by the later middle ages the whole convent\\xe2\\x80\\x94could eat meat dishes not normally allowed in the main dining hall. _NEWLINE_The monks\\' dormitory was on the top floor of the east range, a long room with a high pitched roof (the mark of which can still be seen on the transept wall) which ran the length of the building. This was entered by two staircases: the day stair went down into the cloister in the south-east corner; the night stair led into the south transept of the church to allow the monks to get easily from bed to choir at night. Initially the dormitory was an open hall, with the monks\\' beds placed along the walls, one under each of the small, slit-like windows. During the fourteenth century, when views of the necessity of sleeping in the same space together for the common life changed, the dormitory at Netley would, as at other houses, have been divided into sections with wooden dividers to give every monk his own private area, each leading off a central corridor. The treasury, a tiny vaulted room, was at the north end of the dormitory, preumably located for security at night.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nReredorter and infirmary\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nAnother large building lies crosswise at the south end of the east range. Its lower level consists of a vaulted hall equipped with a grand thirteenth-century hooded fireplace and its own garderobe. It is not clear what this chamber was used for, but it may have been the monastic infirmary\\xe2\\x80\\x94if so, it was a most unusual, perhaps unique, arrangement. Normally in a medieval Cistercian monastery an infirmary with its own kitchens, chapel and ancillary buildings would have been located east of the main buildings around a second, smaller cloister, but at Netley these seem to be absent. So far, excavations have not revealed whether Netley had a separate infirmary complex._NEWLINE_The upper floor of this building was the reredorter or latrine. It is a large room with a door conveniently leading into the monks\\' dormitory. The stalls were in the south wall and the effluent dropped into an underground stream which runs in a vaulted passage underneath the building._NEWLINE_To the west of the reredorter block was the buttery, a room where the monks\\' wine (some of it direct from the king\\'s cellars at Southampton) and beer were stored. Excavations in this area have revealed fragmentary remains which may be part of a separate kitchen for the richer diet allowed to the residents of the infirmary.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nSouth range\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nDuring the Tudor conversion of the abbey to a private house the south range was extensively rebuilt, and only the north wall of the medieval structure remains, which makes tracing the monastic layout difficult. Going east to west, first came the day stair, then the warming house where the communal fire burned constantly to allow the monks to warm themselves after long hours of study in the unheated cloister. The room was probably vaulted and had its great fireplace on the west wall to allow heat to rise to the refectory or dining hall next door. It is likely that, as at the great Cistercian house Fountains Abbey, the chamber above the warming house was the muniment room, where the abbey\\'s charters, records and title deeds, as well as those of local lords, were kept._NEWLINE_The refectory projected south from the centre of the range, as was usual in Cistercian monasteries. This is now almost completely demolished save for the north wall, although the foundations survive underground and have been excavated. It was a long hall with a dais for the abbot and important guests at the south end. There was a pulpit in the west wall to allow a monk to read to the community during the meal. The kitchen lies west; it had a central fireplace, as was Cistercian custom, and was placed to allow food to be served through hatches both to the choir monks\\' refectory and to the separate dining hall for the lay brothers on the west side.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nWest range\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nThe west range at Netley is small and does not run the full length of the west side of the cloister. It is divided in two by the original main entrance to the abbey, with an outer parlour where the monks could meet visitors. North of this on the ground floor were cellars for food storage, and to the south was the lay brothers\\' refectory. The upper floor, reached by a stair from the cloister, was the dormitory for the lay brothers. Netley was a late foundation, built at a time when the lay brothers were a declining part of the Cistercian economy, and it is probable that they were fewer in number, hence the small size of the accommodation needed. By the time the west range was completed in the fourteenth century they were rapidly disappearing, and had all but vanished by the end of the century. During the late fourteenth and fifteenth centuries most Cistercian houses took advantage of the large area of the monastery then left empty and converted the lay brothers\\' quarters to new uses. At some houses, such as Sawley Abbey in Lancashire, a series of comfortable chambers for the use of monastic officials or guests were built; elsewhere, such as Hailes Abbey in Gloucestershire, the west range was turned into a private dwelling of great elegance for the abbot. The ruins of the west range at Netley are too fragmentary to be sure of their purpose in the latter part of the medieval period._NEWLINE_All the buildings around the cloister were finished in the fourteenth century. There were subsequently few major structural changes during the monastic period aside from the re-vaulting of the south transept of the church at the end of the fifteenth century. It is likely, however, that there were many internal changes to match the rising standards of living during the later Middle Ages (as seen at Cleeve Abbey in Somerset) that have left no evidence on the surviving remains.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nPrecinct\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nA stone building to the east of the main complex is thought to have been the abbot\\'s house. It contains two levels of vaulted apartments consisting of two halls, bedchambers, a private chapel and service rooms. The upper level was reached by an external staircase, which allowed this floor to be used independently if needed._NEWLINE_The central core of the monastery was surrounded by a precinct containing an outer (public) courtyard and an inner (private) courtyard, gardens, barns, guesthouses for travellers, stables, fishponds, the home farm and industrial buildings. The site was defended by a high bank and moat, part of which remains east of the abbey. Entrance was strictly controlled by an outer and inner gatehouse. A chapel, known as the capella ante portas (Latin for chapel outside the gates) was placed by the outer gatehouse for the use of travellers and the local population. Of the precinct buildings, only the abbot\\'s house, the moat and the fishponds have left visible remains._NEWLINE_Netley\\'s fresh water was supplied by two aqueducts which ran for several miles east and west of the abbey, up into the areas of modern Southampton and Eastleigh. The remains of the eastern aqueduct, now known as Tickleford Gully, can be seen in Wentworth Gardens, Southampton.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nMonastic history\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nHenry III added to the endowment left by Peter des Roches, donating farmland, urban property in Southampton and elsewhere, and spiritual revenues from churches. By 1291, taxation returns show that the abbey had a clear annual revenue of \\xc2\\xa381, a comfortable income. However, shortly afterwards a period of bad management resulted in the abbey accruing substantial debts, and it was soon almost bankrupt. In 1328 the government was forced to appoint an administrator, John of Mere, to address the crisis. Despite forcing the abbot to apply revenues to debt repayment and to sell many of the estates, the operation was only partly successful. Ten years later the abbey was again appealing to the king for help with a disastrous financial situation. The monks blamed their problems on the cost of providing hospitality to the many travellers by sea, and the king\\'s sailors who landed at the abbey. The king provided some small grants enabling the abbey to overcome its difficulties but the property sales meant that the abbey\\'s income never recovered and it settled into what has been described as genteel poverty._NEWLINE_Nevertheless, Netley remained a much respected institution by its neighbours until the end of its life as a monastery. It was not known for scholarship, wealth, or particular fervour, but it was highly regarded for its generosity to travellers and sailors, and for the devout lives (\"by Raporte of good Religious conversation\") led by its monks. The abbot was summoned on many occasions to sit in Parliament  with fellow prelates in the House of Lords as one of the Lords Spiritual. Surviving reports suggest the abbey had a peaceful and scandal-free domestic life.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nA surviving book\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nIt is not a unique case among English medieval monasteries that almost nothing has survived of what must have been a number of books owned by the house as such or in the keeping of individual monks. These would include at least a small library with biblical texts, spiritual works and perhaps some books on practical subjects, bearing in mind that the management of the abbey plant would have been a considerable challenge. Furthermore, the celebration of the liturgy for a large part of the day and night would necessitate texts for the different participants, who as monks were for the most part not spectators but active participants, some of them with particular roles._NEWLINE_Current scholarship has identified a single book as having belonged to Netley Abbey; it is now conserved as Arundel Ms. 69 in the British Library, London. The volume has an inscription, added in the 15th century on folio 265v: \"Codex iste pertinet ad domum sancte Marie de Netteley\" (\"This codex (i.e. a book not a scroll) belongs to the house of Saint Mary of Netteley\"). The volume itself is a Latin manuscript executed in the 13th century, a copy of Roger of Hoveden\\'s Chronica (\"Chronicles\").   Roger (died c. 1201) was an English historian of the reigns of  Henry II and  Richard I particularly important for his account of the years 1148\\xe2\\x80\\x931170. Little is known in detail about his life, but he may have been a priest and was a courtier to  Henry II, and accompanied  Richard I to the Holy Land on the Third Crusade and served as a local justice in the north of England, and more generally as a negotiator between the crown and various barons and monastic houses.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nDissolution\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nIn 1535 the abbey\\'s income was assessed in the Valor Ecclesiasticus, Henry VIII\\'s general survey of Church finances prior to the plunder, at \\xc2\\xa3160 gross, \\xc2\\xa3100 net, which meant the following year that it came under the terms of the First Suppression Act, Henry\\'s initial move in the Dissolution of the Monasteries. At the beginning of the following year, the king\\'s commissioners, Sir James Worsley, John Paulet, George Paulet and William Berners, delivered a report to the government on the monasteries of Hampshire which provides a snapshot of Netley on the eve of the Dissolution. The commissioners noted that Netley was inhabited by seven monks, all of them priests, and the abbey was:_NEWLINE_A hedde house of Monkes of thordre of Cisteaux, beinge of large buyldinge and situate upon the Ryvage of the Sees.

The royal officers also found plate and jewels (these were certainly objects for worship, such as reliquaries or crosses) in the treasury worth \\xc2\\xa343, \"ornaments\" worth \\xc2\\xa339, and agricultural produce and animals worth \\xc2\\xa3103. The abbey\\'s debts were moderate at \\xc2\\xa342._NEWLINE_Abbot Thomas Stevens and his seven monks were forced to surrender their house to the king in the summer of 1536.  Abbot Thomas Stevens and six of his brethren\\xe2\\x80\\x94the seventh opted to resign and become a secular priest\\xe2\\x80\\x94crossed  Southampton Water to join their mother house of Beaulieu. Abbot Stevens was appointed Abbot of Beaulieu in 1536 and administered it for two years until Beaulieu in turn was forced to surrender to the king in April 1538. The monks received pensions after the fall of Beaulieu; Abbot Thomas ended his days as treasurer of Salisbury Cathedral, and died in 1550.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nCountry house\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nFollowing the dissolution of Netley, on 3 August 1536, King Henry granted the abbey buildings and some of its estates to Sir William Paulet, his Lord Treasurer and subsequently Marquess of Winchester. As soon as he took over, Sir William started the process of turning the abbey into a palace suitable for one of the most important politicians in England. He converted the nave of the church into his great hall, kitchens and service buildings, the transepts and crossing became a series of luxurious apartments for his personal use, the presbytery was retained as the chapel of the mansion. The monks\\' dormitory became the long gallery of the mansion and the latrine block became several grand chambers. He demolished the south range and refectory and built a new one with a central turreted gatehouse to provide the appropriate seigneurial emphasis needed for a classic Tudor courtyard house. He likewise demolished the cloister walks to make a central courtyard for his house and placed a large fountain in the centre. The precinct buildings were demolished to create formal gardens and terraces._NEWLINE_His eventual successor William Paulet, 4th Marquess of Winchester (c.1560-1629) of Basing House, Hampshire, on encountering financial difficulties, sold Basing and Hound in 1602 to Edward Seymour, 1st Earl of Hertford (1539-1621), of Tottenham House in Wiltshire, who used it as a residence, and died there in 1621. His eventual descendant William Seymour, 3rd Duke of Somerset (1652-1671) died aged 19 without progeny when his title passed by law to his heir male but his unentailed estates including Netley and Hound, passed top his sister Elizabeth Seymour, wife of Thomas Bruce, 2nd Earl of Ailesbury (1656-1741), who sold Netley in 1676 to Henry Somerset, 3rd Marquess of Worcester (1629-1700), later Duke of Beaufort._NEWLINE_Theophilus Hastings, 7th Earl of Huntingdon, inhabited the abbey until the close of the seventeenth century.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nRomantic ruin\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nAround 1700, Netley Abbey came into the hands of Sir Berkeley Lucy (also spelled Sir \"Bartlet\"), who decided in 1704 to demolish the by now unfashionable house in order to sell the materials. Sir Berkeley made an agreement with a Southampton builder, Mr Walter Taylor, to take down the former church. However, during the course of the demolition, the contractor was killed by the fall of tracery from the west window of the church and the scheme was halted._NEWLINE_The abbey was subsequently abandoned and allowed to decay. In the 1760s Thomas Dummer, who owned estates in the area, moved the north transept to his estate at Cranbury Park near Winchester where it can be still be seen as a folly in the gardens of the house (at 51\\xc2\\xb000\\xe2\\x80\\xb208\\xe2\\x80\\xb3N 01\\xc2\\xb021\\xe2\\x80\\xb249\\xe2\\x80\\xb3W)._NEWLINE_By the second half of the eighteenth century, the abbey, by then partially roofless and overgrown with trees and ivy, had become a famous ruin that attracted the attention of artists, dramatists and poets. In the nineteenth century, Netley became a popular tourist attraction (the novelist Jane Austen was among those who visited) and steps were taken to conserve the ruins. Archaeological excavations directed by Charles Pink and Reverend Edmund Kell took place in 1860. During the same period the owners decided to remove many of the Tudor additions to the building to create a more medieval feel to the site, resulting in the loss of much evidence of the abbey\\'s post-Dissolution story._NEWLINE_In 1922, the abbey was passed into state care by the then owner, Tankerville Chamberlayne, one time M.P. for Southampton. Conservation and archaeological work on the abbey has continued.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nIn literature and art\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nSoon after the abbey had been allowed to fall into ruin, it began to attract the attention of artists and writers, and was a popular subject throughout the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. In 1755, the antiquarian Horace Walpole praised the ruins in his letters following a visit with the poet Thomas Gray, claiming they were \"In short, not the ruins of Netley, but of Paradise\". In 1764, George Keate wrote The Ruins of Netley Abbey, A poem, which showed a romantic appreciation of the ruins and evoked sympathy for the life formerly led there by the monks. He prefaced his poem with a heartfelt plea for the preservation of the remains. _NEWLINE_Keate was followed by other romantic poets including William Sotheby (Ode, Netley Abbey, Midnight, 1790). Sotheby\\'s view of the abbey was gothic; he peoples the ruins with spectral processions and ghostly Cistercians. Nor was he the only one; in 1795 Richard Warner wrote a potboiler entitled Netley Abbey, a Gothic Story in two volumes, featuring skullduggery at the abbey during the middle ages. Dark deeds before the Dissolution also appeared in the section of Richard Harris Barham\\'s Ingoldsby Legends (1837\\xe2\\x80\\x931845) covering Netley. This complex satire pokes fun at the medieval church and the monks (whom he accuses of having walled up an erring nun in one of the vaults and ensuring God\\'s revenge upon them) and the tourists who crowded contemporary Netley, while at the same time showing appreciation of the beauty of the ruins._NEWLINE_Netley Abbey, an Operatic Farce, by William Pearce, was first performed in 1794 at Covent Garden. The set of the first production featured an elaborate mockup of the abbey ruins seen in the moonlight._NEWLINE_The earliest surviving depiction of the abbey is by the engravers Samuel and Nathaniel Buck, who specialised in landmarks and great ruins. Their engraving (1733) shows the church of the abbey much as it is today, with the exception of the high vault of the south transept still present. The picture has notable errors and was clearly done from memory and rough sketches. The most famous artist to paint the ruins was John Constable, whose 1833 painting of the west end of the church shows it among trees.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nCondition\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nThe visitor today will find the shell of the church and monastic buildings around the cloister plus the abbot\\'s house. Little of the post-Dissolution mansion remains aside from the south range, foundations, alterations to the medieval structure in red Tudor brick and traces of the formal gardens. In most places the abbey stands close to its original height. The sacristy/library, the south transept chapels, the treasury, the reredorter undercroft and the lower floor of the abbot\\'s house still have their vaults intact. Medieval heraldic polychrome tiles found on the site can be seen in the sacristy, and Henry III\\'s foundation stone remains in the church. The abbey ruins are set in wooded parkland to the west of the village of Netley and constitute the most complete surviving Cistercian monastery in southern England. The site is maintained by English Heritage, and is open to the public. Netley is an Ancient Monument protected by law.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nEvents\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nDuring the summer months the abbey is occasionally host to events such as open-air theatre and was the site of a flashmob wedding on 25 June 2011.\\n_START_SECTION_\\n2018 closure\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nNetley Abbey was closed to the public in June 2018 due to safety concerns.

Legend has it that before starting the work he was warned in a dream that he would be punished if he committed sacrilege by damaging the building. The story is recounted by the eighteenth-century antiquary Browne Walters:_NEWLINE_The earl (sic), it is said, made a contract with a Mr. Walter Taylor, a builder of Southampton, for the complete demolition of the Abbey; it being intended by Taylor to employ the materials in erecting a town house at Newport and other buildings. After making this agreement, however, Taylor dreamed that, as he was pulling down a particular window, one of the stones forming the arch fell upon him, and killed him. His dream impressed him so forcibly that he mentioned the circumstance to a friend, who is said to have been the father of the well-known Dr. Isaac Watts, and in some perplexity asked his advice. His friend thought it would be the safest course for him to have nothing to do with the affair, respecting which he had been so alarmingly forewarned, and endeavoured to persuade him to desist from his intention. Taylor, however, at last decided upon paying no attention to his dream, and accordingly began his operations for the pulling down of the building; in which he had not proceeded far, when, as he was assisting at the work, the arch of one of the windows, but not the one he had dreamed of (which was the east window still standing), fell upon his head and fractured his skull. It was thought at first that the wound would not prove mortal; but it was aggravated through the unskilfulness of the surgeon, and the man died._NEWLINE_\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\xe2\\x80\\x89Browne Walters\\n_START_SECTION_\\nBlind Peter\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nAnother local legend states that during the Dissolution of the Monasteries the abbey\\'s treasure was hidden down a secret tunnel with a lone monk to guard it.

The big claw or chela which gives it its common name can be either the right or left claw and is disproportionally large, measuring half the length of the body. It has a deep notch on either side beneath the finger joint. The other claw is unmodified and of normal size. The bigclaw is the largest species of snapping shrimp in its home range, growing to a maximum length of 5.5 centimetres (2.2\\xc2\\xa0in), but most adults are considerably smaller than this. Its colour is a translucent dark green with orange and blue tips to the uropods.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nDistribution and habitat\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nThe bigclaw snapping shrimp is found in tropical and semitropical waters in the Gulf of Mexico, the West Indies, Bermuda, and the western Atlantic Ocean from Cape Hatteras south to Florida and Brazil. It lives close to the seabed in shallow waters favouring reefs, seagrass meadows, salt marshes and muddy areas. It often conceals itself in a natural aperture during the day though it is unclear whether it can dig itself a burrow.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nBiology\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nThe bigclaw snapping shrimp produces a loud, staccato concussive noise with its snapping claw. The sound is produced when the claw snaps shut at great speed creating a high-speed water jet. This creates a small, short-lived cavitation bubble and it is the immediate collapse of this bubble that creates the sound. A spark is formed at the same time. The snapping noise serves to deter predators and to stun prey, and is also used for display purposes._NEWLINE_The bigclaw snapping shrimp feeds on worms, small crustaceans and fish such as gobies and pearlfish. It is itself eaten by the weakfish (Cynoscion regalis). It is often associated with the black-clawed mud crab (Panopeus herbstii), sharing the crab's burrow and remaining uneaten, even though this crab eats similar-sized shrimps of other species._NEWLINE_Bigclaw snapping shrimps mostly live as monogamous pairs. The female is only receptive for a short time just after moulting. The eggs hatch about four weeks after being laid and the larvae do not feed, but instead rely on their egg yolks. They develop very quickly and pass through their three larval stages in about five days. The newly metamorphosed juvenile shrimps have equal sized chelae; one of these enlarges at a later stage.\"</td>\n",

Originally favouring a harsh, guitar-orientated urban indie sound, the band passed through a more ethereal art rock mid-period and ultimately arrived at a more groove-orientated, jazz-influenced sound incorporating electronica, elements of Brazilian music and electric-period Miles Davis. At various times, the band cited influences including Mogwai, Cocteau Twins, Low, art rock from 1990s Chicago (such as Tortoise and The For Carnation) and Montreal (Godspeed You! Black Emperor) and 1970s Britain (King Crimson). Reviewers sometimes compared them to the bands Stereolab, Bardo Pond, Movietone, Pram, Tarwater and Parlour.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nFormation and early lineups\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nCaroline Ross had played guitar or bass in various London bands during the 1990s, latterly teaming up with fine artist Jim Brook (who also played music under the name of Jim Version). The duo\\'s first band was Ripley, soon renamed Vaughan. By 1998, after various line-up changes, this had metamorphosed into Delicate AWOL, in which Ross (vocals, guitar, flute) and Version (guitar) were joined by Yann Faurie (drums) and Valerie Lockett from London (bass guitar). Ensconcing themselves in Toby Robinson\\'s Moat Studios in Stockwell, the band began to work on refining their sound._NEWLINE_In 1999, Ross and Version set up the Day Release record label to release their own future recordings and those of others. (Releases on the label eventually included material by Robinson\\'s Krautrock project The Nazgul, singer songwriter David Hurn, Godspeed You! Black Emperor spinoff Trois Pistoles, The Monsoon Bassoon, and many others). One of the first Day Release releases, in mid-1999, was Delicate AWOL\\'s debut EP Random Blinking Lights. At this stage, the band was still very much in an art-rock/indie rock vein, sporting an abrasive edge, relatively simple rhythms, Version\\'s heavily distorted guitar and Ross singing in an incantatory tone reminiscent of Patti Smith. The band also developed a short-lived all-instrumental alter ego called Forty Shades Of Black, releasing a simultaneous single called \"Belisha\". A tour of England and Scotland to promote both of the new releases ended with some changes to the line-up in Scotland with Faurie and Lockett leaving the group to work on other projects. Delicate AWOL completed their tour obligations playing the final gig of the tour at King Tut\\'s in Glasgow as a two-piece of Ross and Version.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nStabilising the line-up, and Our Genome\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nHeartened by the positive audience reception in Glasgow, Ross and Version returned to London and began recording their debut album, Our Genome, as a duo. When Michael Donnelly (bass) and Tom Page (drums) were recruited into the band mid-sessions Ross and Version became so enthused with their new bandmates\\xe2\\x80\\x99 contributions that they scrapped the original version of Our Genome altogether and began rewriting and recording the album from scratch. (Some tracks from the original Our Genome sessions surfaced later as EP tracks, and a few complete copies of the shelved album are in private hands)._NEWLINE_In the summer of 2000, Delicate AWOL released the \"Hurray for Sugar\" single - a delicate, whispering song which clearly indicated that the band had moved on from their more abrasive beginnings. Tom Page\\'s percussionist brother Ben Page was added to the line-up, and Ross added more instruments to her live armoury (including ocarina, melodica and assorted small percussion instruments). The band\\'s next release was part of the Day Release \"Four Seasons Singles Club\", a series of releases each of which featured three EPs from three different artists: Delicate AWOL contributed three tracks to the \"Autumn\" issue. In November 2000, the band performed at the fourth Terrastock festival in Seattle, Washington State, USA._NEWLINE_Our Genome was released by Day Release Records in the spring of 2001. It displayed a much-evolved band sound \\xe2\\x80\\x93 more cohesive and dynamic, and considerably quieter, with added instrumentation (including horns) on several tracks. Demonstrating the band\\'s intention to keep moving, it featured none of the early singles and no previously released tracks. The band were now heading in a post-rock direction, with Ross\\xe2\\x80\\x99 vocals assuming more of an ensemble/instrumental quality and various experiments with textures._NEWLINE_By this time, Delicate AWOL had also established themselves as a significant band within the London math rock scene, sharing stages and audiences with bands such as The Monsoon Bassoon, Rothko, The Shrubbies (featuring future North Sea Radio Orchestra members), Geiger Counter, Billy Mahonie and others. For a while, they also ran their own club night, \"Everywhere Is Mouse\", in the basement of Helter Skelter music bookstore in Denmark Street. The event attracted performers including The Monsoon Bassoon, Stewart Lee and Al Murray (performing as part of a band), Keith Burstein and others._NEWLINE_Adding trumpeter Jo Wright to the line-up, Delicate AWOL toured America during the summer of 2001 and returned to play the fifth Terrastock festival (this time in Boston) in October. The Driesh EP, released in autumn 2001 (with the band\\'s elegiac set-closer \"Dust\" as the lead track) ended the band\\'s middle period. One track - the instrumental \"Evergreen China Prairie Tribunal\" - pointed the way forward towards the next phase.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nHeart Drops from the Great Space\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nAs a live act, Delicate AWOL were becoming more and more influenced by the lighter and more fluid rhythms of jazz, with the rhythm section now embracing spacious groove and Latin-inspired rhythms, Wright improvising complex trumpet lines and Ben Page playing analogue-style synthesizers as well as percussion. Although Version\\'s overdriven guitar maintained a link to the band\\'s art rock past, Ross was now a committed multi-instrumentalist with a vocal style that had begun to incorporate folk, Latin and swing stylings._NEWLINE_In 2002, the band signed a deal with the revived indie label Fire Records and wound up Day Release Records in order to concentrate on band work (David Hurn also made the crossing from Day Release to Fire). The band\\'s second album, Heart Drops From The Great Space was released on Fire Records the same year and was accompanied by the 12-inch vinyl EP Time And Motion Studies Deep Underground. Both clearly demonstrated the evolution of the live band, who also cemented their links with Rothko by providing most of the instrumentation on the 2004 Rothko album A Continual Search for Origins.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nRelocation and split\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nIn 2003, Delicate AWOL relocated from London to the village of Huntly (in Aberdeenshire, Scotland). This was apparently an attempt to escape urban pressures, to liberate their musical creativity (including Version\\'s burgeoning career as a sound engineer and producer) and to get more involved in both community activity and the band\\'s other love - visual art. In fact, the move led to the slow disintegration of the band. While maintaining her links with Delicate AWOL, Jo Wright had already left the active lineup: she was shortly followed by bass player Donnelly.  In 2005 the Page brothers also left the band and returned to London._NEWLINE_Donelly was replaced for a while by the Aberdeen-based Philip Johnston (who also doubled on flute and saxophone). A final version of Delicate AWOL performed at the Tunnels club in Aberdeen on 10 April 2005, with a line-up of Ross, Version, Neil Scollay (drums), Danny Ashton (guitar), Kate Mutsaers and Martha Buckingham (vocals) The same lineup (plus Marian Nagahiro) performed at Forgue Kirk near Huntly on 30 April 2005. Ross and Version quietly dissolved Delicate AWOL shortly afterwards, having found that their new compositions were unsuited to the restrictions of a settled band.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nPost-split activities\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nRoss and Version continued to work together for a few years as the avant-folk/experimental duo Tells before going their separate ways. Songs originally conceived for the third Delicate AWOL album appeared on Tells\\' lone 2006 album Hope Your Wounds Heal. While still with Tells, Caroline Ross contributed to two tracks on Susumu Yokota\\'s 2005 album Distant Sounds of Summer as well as recording a collaboration album with Rothko called A Place Between (credited to Rothko/Caroline Ross)._NEWLINE_Jim Version - reverting to his original surname of Brooks - would subsequently relocate to Cheltenham, where he remained involved in art and music. Returning to London and the south-east, Ross joined the live band of experimental folk musician Woodpecker Wooliams in 2009, singing and playing flute, glockenspiel, omnichord, cheese-grater and other instrument and items._NEWLINE_Regarding the other former members of Delicate AWOL, Michael Donelly would return to London and continue as part of the second and third lineups of Rothko, while Tom and Ben Page would form the improvising instrumental duo Rocketnumbernine (working both solo and with artists such as Neneh Cherry). Under her married name of Downs, Jo Wright went on to work with The Sweet Believers and assorted jazz orchestras.'</td>\n",

Since 1988 The Felix Meritis Foundation has been located in the building as a European centre for art, culture and science.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nHistory\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nIt was built according to a winning design by the architect Jacob Otten Husly for the new society called Felix Meritis established in 1776 for Music, Drawing, Physics, Commerce and Literature in the modern neo-classical style. Husly had won a similar design contest for the city hall of Groningen in the previous year. The building itself was meant to exemplify the Enlightenment ideals the society stood for. The classical temple fa\\xc3\\xa7ade with its colossal Corinthian pilasters and pediment represent the society\\'s five departments with five sculptures representing the visual arts and architecture, literature, trade, natural sciences and music. The interior includes original 18th-century features such as the central staircase, the oval concert hall (renowned for its acoustics) and the domed roof - underneath which there used to be an astronomical observatory. _NEWLINE_On 31 October 1788 the building of the same name opened its doors. The society focused on the promotion of arts and sciences in a broader sense than the artists collectives popular at the time. Husly was himself a board member of the Amsterdam city drawing academy Stadstekenacademie, that had close contacts with the Oeconomischen Tak van de Hollandsche Maatschappij der Wetenschappen (economics branch of the Hollandsche Maatschappij der Wetenschappen, which met in the Trippenhuis). The society was abolished in 1888._NEWLINE_Felix Meritis\\xe2\\x80\\x99 oval concert hall was the main music hall in Amsterdam until late into the 19th century and enjoyed a great international reputation. Many famous musicians performed there, including Robert and Clara Schumann, Camille Saint-Sa\\xc3\\xabns, Johannes Brahms and Julius R\\xc3\\xb6ntgen. The orchestra of Felix Meritis was regarded as the best of the Netherlands and accompanied many Dutch premieres, directed by conductors such as Johannes Bernardus van Bree. Thus, Beethoven\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Ninth Symphony and Berlioz\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Symphonie fantastique had their Dutch premiere  in the concert hall of Felix Meritis. The small hall of the Concertgebouw is a replica of this concert hall.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nTwentieth century\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nWhen the old Felix Meritis society was dissolved in 1888, the printing company Holdert & Co., which became one of Amsterdam\\'s largest printing companies, moved into the building. In 1932 part of the building was destroyed in a fire. After the Second World War the Communist Party of the Netherlands set up its headquarters in the building. From 1947 until 1981 its newspaper \\'De Waarheid\\' (\\'The Truth\\') rolled from the presses. In the 50s, Felix Meritis became the symbol of communism in the Netherlands. This image became especially embedded in the collective memory when the building was stormed on 4 November 1956, in response to the Soviet invasion of Hungary and its endorsement by the Dutch communist party. However, in the late sixties, Felix Meritis became a cradle of evenings for alternative youth, which were named Provadya. In 1969 the Shaffy Theater opened, which gained a reputation as a stopping place for the Dutch avant-garde, including Ramses Shaffy, Baal, Neerlands Hoop, Independent Theater and Hauser Orkater.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nCentre for art, culture and science\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nIn 1988, one hundred years after the old society was dissolved, The Felix Meritis foundation was re-established in the building as a European center for art, culture and science. Felix Meritis is an independent international meeting place and serves as director of the European public debate, cultural processes and international projects and exchanges. Felix Meritis presents itself as a knowledge institution and platform for European cultural dialogue and cultural-political issues. The motto of Felix Meritis is Connecting Cultures. In collaboration with partners from home and abroad Felix Meritis initiates projects such as A Soul for Europe, Amsterdam Forum, The People Network, Gulliver Connect, Amsterdam Summer University, Dare2Connect, The European House for Culture (Brussels), Night of Philosophy, Cafe Europa, The Globalization Lecture Foundation and Kuhnya.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nFelix in de Steigers\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nIn November 2014 the management company Amerborgh, owned by Alex Mulder purchased Felix Meritis from the city of Amsterdam. Amerborgh will start renovating the building in 2017. During 2015 en 2016 the building houses the temporary project \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFelix in de Steigers\\xe2\\x80\\x9d providing space for art, theatre and several experimental cultural programmes until construction is under way.'</td>\n",

These edifices marked the burial sites of many eminent Egyptians during Egypt\\'s Early Dynastic Period and Old Kingdom. In the Old Kingdom epoch, local kings began to be buried in pyramids instead of in mastabas, although non-royal use of mastabas continued for over a thousand years. Egyptologists call these tombs mastaba, from the Arabic word \\xd9\\x85\\xd8\\xb5\\xd8\\xb7\\xd8\\xa8\\xd8\\xa9 (ma\\xe1\\xb9\\xa3\\xe1\\xb9\\xadaba) \"stone bench\".\\n_START_SECTION_\\nHistory\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nThe afterlife was an important part of Ancient Egyptian religion. This is reflected in their architecture and most prominently by the enormous amounts of time, money, and labour involved in the building of tombs. Ancient Egyptians believed the soul could live only if the body was preserved from corruption and depredation as well as fed._NEWLINE_Starting in the Predynastic era and continuing into the later dynasties, the ancient Egyptians developed increasingly complex and effective methods for preserving and protecting the bodies of the dead. They buried their dead in pit graves dug out from the sand; the body placed on a mat, usually along with some items believed to help them in the afterlife. The first tomb structure which the Egyptians developed was the mastaba, composed of earthen bricks made from soil along the Nile. It provided better protection from scavenging animals and from grave robbers. As the remains were not in contact with the dry desert sand, natural mummification could not take place; therefore the Egyptians devised a system of artificial mummification. Until at least the Old Period or First Intermediate Period, only high officials and royalty would be buried in these mastabas.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nStructure\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nThe word \\'mastaba\\' comes from the Arabic word for a bench of mud. When seen from a distance, a flat-topped mastaba does resemble a bench. Historians speculate that the Egyptians may have borrowed architectural ideas from Mesopotamia, since at the time they were both building similar structures._NEWLINE_The above-ground structure of a mastaba is rectangular in shape with inward-sloping sides and a flat roof. The exterior building materials were initially bricks made of the sun-dried mud readily available from the Nile River. Even after more durable materials such as stone came into use, all but the most important monumental structures were built from mudbricks. Mastabas were often about four times as long as they were wide, and many rose to at least 30 feet in height. They were oriented North-South, which the Egyptians believed was essential for access to the afterlife. The above-ground structure had space for a small offering chapel equipped with a false door. Priests and family members brought food and other offerings for the soul, or ba, of the deceased, which had to be maintained in order to continue to exist in the afterlife._NEWLINE_Inside the mastaba, a deep chamber was dug into the ground and lined with stone and bricks. The burial chambers were cut deep, until they passed the bedrock, and were lined with wood.  A second hidden chamber called a serdab (\\xd8\\xb3\\xd8\\xb1\\xd8\\xaf\\xd8\\xa7\\xd8\\xa8), from the Persian word for \"cellar\", was used to store anything that may have been considered essential for the comfort of the deceased in the afterlife, such as beer, grain, clothes, and precious items. The mastaba housed a statue of the deceased that was hidden within the masonry for its protection. High up the walls of the serdab were small openings that would allow the ba to leave and return to the body (represented by the statue); Ancient Egyptians believed the ba had to return to its body or it would die.  These openings \"were not meant for viewing the statue but rather for allowing the fragrance of burning incense, and possibly the spells spoken in rituals, to reach the statue\".\\n_START_SECTION_\\nArchitectural evolution\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nThe mastaba was the standard type of tomb in pre-dynastic and early dynastic Egypt for both the pharaoh and the social elite. The ancient  city of Abydos was the location chosen for many of the cenotaphs. The royal cemetery was at Saqqara, overlooking the capital of early times, Memphis._NEWLINE_Mastabas evolved over the early dynastic period. During the 1st Dynasty, a mastaba was constructed simulating house plans of several rooms, a central one containing the sarcophagus and others surrounding it to receive the abundant funerary offerings. The whole was built in a shallow pit above which a brick superstructure covering a broad area. The typical 2nd and 3rd Dynasty mastabas was the \\'stairway mastaba\\', the tomb chamber of which sank deeper than before and was connected to the top with an inclined shaft and stairs._NEWLINE_Even after pharaohs began to construct pyramids for their tombs in the 3rd Dynasty, members of the nobility continued to be buried in mastaba tombs. This is especially evident on the Giza Plateau, where at least 150 mastaba tombs have been constructed alongside the pyramids._NEWLINE_In the 4th Dynasty (c. 2613 to 2494 BC), rock-cut tombs began to appear. These were tombs built into the rock cliffs in Upper Egypt in an attempt to further thwart grave robbers. Mastabas, then, were developed with the addition of offering chapels and vertical shafts. 5th Dynasty mastabas had elaborate chapels consisting of several rooms, columned halls and \\'serdab\\'. The actual tomb chamber was built below the south-end of mastaba, connected by a slanting passage to a stairway emerging in the center of a columned hall or court._NEWLINE_Mastabas are still well attested in the Middle Kingdom. Here they had a revival. They were often solid structures with the decoration only on the outside. _NEWLINE_By the time of the New Kingdom (which began with the 18th Dynasty around 1550 BC), \"the mastaba becomes rare, being largely superseded by the independent pyramid chapel above a burial chamber\".'</td>\n",

It is comparable in many respects to the European Union\\'s NESSIE project and to the Advanced Encryption Standard process run by NIST in the U.S..\\n_START_SECTION_\\nComparison with NESSIE\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nThere is some overlap, and some conflict, between the NESSIE selections and the CRYPTREC draft recommendations. Both efforts include some of the best cryptographers in the world therefore conflicts in their selections and recommendations should be examined with care. For instance, CRYPTREC recommends several 64 bit block ciphers while NESSIE selected none, but CRYPTREC was obliged by its terms of reference to take into account existing standards and practices, while NESSIE was not. Similar differences in terms of reference account for CRYPTREC recommending at least one stream cipher, RC4, while the NESSIE report specifically said that it was notable that they had not selected any of those considered. RC4 is widely used in the SSL/TLS protocols; nevertheless, CRYPTREC recommended that it only be used with 128-bit keys. Essentially the same consideration led to CRYPTREC\\'s inclusion of 160-bit message digest algorithms, despite their suggestion that they be avoided in new system designs. Also, CRYPTREC was unusually careful to examine variants and modifications of the techniques, or at least to discuss their care in doing so; this resulted in particularly detailed recommendations regarding them.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nResponsibilities\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nIt is also the organization providing technical evaluation and recommendations in regard to regulations implementing Japanese laws: examples include that on Electronic Signatures and Certification Services (Law 102 of FY2000, taking effect as from April 2001), the Basic Law on the Formulation of an Advanced Information and Telecommunications Network Society of 2000 (Law 144 of FY2000), and the Public Individual Certification Law of December 2002. Furthermore, CRYPTEC has responsibilities with regard to the Japanese contribution to the ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC27 standardization effort.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nSelection\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nFirst release in 2003, many Japanese ciphers were selected for \"e-Government Recommended Ciphers List\"; CIPHERUNICORN-E (NEC), Hierocrypt-L1 (Toshiba), MISTY1 (Mitsubishi Electric) as 64 bit block ciphers, Camellia (Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, Mitsubishi Electric), CIPHERUNICORN-A (NEC), Hierocrypt-3 (Toshiba), SC2000(Fujitsu) as 128 bit block ciphers, MUGI, MULTI-S01 (Hitachi) as stream ciphers._NEWLINE_Revised release in 2013, list was divided to three, \"e-Government Recommended Ciphers List\", \"Candidate Recommended Ciphers List\", and \"Monitored Ciphers List\". Most of Japanese ciphers listed in previous list (except for Camellia) have moved from \"Recommended Ciphers List\" to \"Candidate Recommended Ciphers List\". There were several new proposals like CLEFIA (Sony) as 128 bit block cipher, KCipher-2 (KDDI), Enocoro-128v2 (Hitachi) as stream ciphers, however, only KCipher-2 has been listed on \"e-Government Recommended Ciphers List\". The reason why most of Japanese ciphers have not been selected as \"Recommended Ciphers\" is not that these ciphers are unsafe, but that these ciphers are not widely used in commercial products, open-source projects, governmental systems, international standards. There is possibility that ciphers listed on \"Candidate Recommended Ciphers List\" will be moved to \"e-Government Recommended Ciphers List\" when they are used in many systems._NEWLINE_In addition, 128 bit RC4 and SHA-1 are listed on \"Monitored Ciphers List\". These are unsafe and only permitted to keep compatibilities with old systems.'</td>\n",

Mark is of Italian descent. Dantonio\\'s Grandfather Frank D\\'antonio moved from Montenerodomo, Italy, to the United States - losing the apostrophe at Ellis Island \\xe2\\x80\\x93 in 1912. Mark was the second of four boys. When Mark was one, the family moved to Zanesville, Ohio, where Justin became the vice principal and basketball coach at Zanesville High School. Mark was an all-state safety at Zanesville.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nCollege career\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nDantonio attended the University of South Carolina and earned three letters as a defensive back for Coach Jim Carlen for the Gamecocks 1976-78. He earned a bachelor\\'s degree in education from South Carolina in 1979. Dantonio later earned a master\\'s degree in education from Ohio University in 1980.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nEarly coaching career\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nDantonio began his coaching career at Ohio University, where he was a graduate assistant.  In 1981, he made his first stop in the Big Ten Conference when he moved on to Purdue University as a graduate assistant. He spent two years, in 1983 and 1984, as a graduate assistant at Ohio State University  under head coach Earle Bruce. In 1986, he began a five-year stint on Jim Tressel\\'s staff at Youngstown State University as a defensive secondary coach.  In 1990, Dantonio led the Penguins\\' defense to an 11\\xe2\\x80\\x930 record and a #2 ranking nationally.  Glen Mason hired Dantonio in 1991 to be the defensive secondary coach for the Kansas Jayhawks. When Nick Saban was hired at Michigan State in 1995, he hired Dantonio to join his staff in East Lansing where he remained even after Saban left for LSU.  After Bobby Williams was named head coach in 1999 following Saban\\'s departure, Dantonio was promoted to associate head coach where he remained through the 2000 season._NEWLINE_At Ohio State in 2001, Dantonio reunited with his former Youngstown State boss and good friend Jim Tressel when he opted out of East Lansing to serve as defensive coordinator at Ohio State University for three seasons.  His defense became known as one of the stingiest in the country. During the Buckeyes\\' 2002 National Championship season, Ohio State ranked second nationally in scoring defense and third in rushing defense. For his efforts, Dantonio was named a 2002 finalist for the Broyles Award, given annually to the nation\\'s top college football assistant coach. In the 2003 season, his defense ranked number one in the country in rushing defense and ninth in total defense, which led the Buckeyes to an 11\\xe2\\x80\\x932 record and #4 national ranking.  Six Buckeye defenders were named first team All-Big Ten during Dantonio\\'s tenure. Thirteen were drafted into the NFL, including two first round picks in Chris Gamble and Will Smith.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nCincinnati\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nDantonio was named head coach at Cincinnati on December 23, 2003. He became the first head coach in 23 years to lead the school to a winning season in his first season at UC. The Bearcats\\' 7\\xe2\\x80\\x935 record included a 5\\xe2\\x80\\x933 record in Conference USA, which was good enough for a second-place finish. The Bearcats finished the season on a winning note with a 32\\xe2\\x80\\x9314 win over Marshall in the PlainsCapital Fort Worth Bowl.  During Dantonio\\'s time at UC, he led the Bearcats to a bowl game victory and directed the team\\'s transition into the Big East Conference. As head coach, Dantonio had 15 players earn all-conference honors and 25 received conference academic recognition.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nMichigan State\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nMark Dantonio became the 24th head coach at Michigan State on November 27, 2006. Upon his arrival, Dantonio planned to return the Spartans to a more traditional philosophy on offense and defense, eliminating the spread offense and the \"bandit\" linebacker/safety position used under previous head coach John L. Smith.\\n_START_SECTION_\\n2007 season\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nDantonio began his Michigan State career well at Spartan Stadium when on April 21, 2007, Michigan State drew over 25,000 fans to watch the team\\'s spring scrimmage game. The white team, led by sophomore quarterback Connor Dixon, defeated junior quarterback Brian Hoyer and the green team by a score of 21\\xe2\\x80\\x938. During the game, Dantonio was seen behind the line of scrimmage watching and coaching the action._NEWLINE_Dantonio won his first game at Michigan State on September 1, 2007, when the Spartans defeated the UAB Blazers, 55\\xe2\\x80\\x9318. His first season at Michigan State was the school\\'s most successful since 2003. Dantonio\\'s Spartans went 7\\xe2\\x80\\x935, losing all five games by seven points or fewer, and were bowl eligible for the first time in four years. However, the Spartans lost to Boston College in the Champs Sports Bowl in Orlando on December 28.\\n_START_SECTION_\\n2008 season\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nDantonio\\'s second season at MSU began with a loss at Cal, after which the Spartans came home and won six straight games against Eastern Michigan, Florida Atlantic, Notre Dame, Indiana, Iowa, and Northwestern. The victories propelled Michigan State into the top 25. Following a lopsided 45\\xe2\\x80\\x937 loss to the Ohio State Buckeyes, the Spartans beat Michigan, 35\\xe2\\x80\\x9321, winning in Ann Arbor for the first time since 1990. Michigan State won its final two home games against Wisconsin and Purdue before losing to Penn State in Happy Valley. A win against Penn State would have resulted in Michigan State splitting the Big Ten Conference title with Ohio State. The nine regular season wins were Michigan State\\'s most since 1999. Michigan State finished third in the conference and was invited to play Georgia in the Capital One Bowl.

He later suffered a heart attack. He had a stent implanted in a blocked artery near his heart. His doctor stated that the damage was minimal and that Dantonio was expected to make a full recovery. Offensive coordinator Don Treadwell became acting head coach while Dantonio recovered._NEWLINE_On September 30, after Dantonio had stated that he would be coaching the next game from the press box and just two days before Michigan State played Wisconsin, Dantonio was admitted back into the hospital as a blood clot was found in his leg. Dantonio had to watch the game from his hospital room. He was reportedly released from Sparrow Hospital around noon on October 4, 2010. On October 9, Dantonio coached his first game since his heart attack against rival Michigan. Michigan State won the game, 34\\xe2\\x80\\x9317, in Ann Arbor._NEWLINE_The Spartans under Dantonio continued to win and on November 20 reached 10\\xe2\\x80\\x931 on the season, winning all home games for the first time during his tenure. It was just the third time in school history that Michigan State had won 10 or more games in a season, the other two seasons being those of 1965 and 1999. On November 27, 2010, Dantonio\\'s Spartans defeated Penn State 28\\xe2\\x80\\x9322 in Happy Valley to finish the season 11\\xe2\\x80\\x931 and clinch a share of the Big Ten Championship for the first time since 1990. On December 5, 2010, MSU announced that the Spartans were selected to play in the Capital One Bowl on January 1, 2011, against Alabama (ranked 15th in the BCS standings).

The Spartans finished 10\\xe2\\x80\\x932 (7\\xe2\\x80\\x931 in Big Ten play), earning the Legends Division championship and a place in the inaugural Big Ten Championship Game. After coming up just short in a rematch with Wisconsin, MSU was selected to play in the Outback Bowl against the Georgia Bulldogs. Dantonio led his team to a triple-overtime victory, his first bowl win at MSU.

The season started with promise, when preseason #13 Michigan State beat #24 Boise State; but two games later, the #10 Spartans lost to No. 20 Notre Dame, and went on to suffer four home losses in Big Ten play. The defense finished ninth in FBS points allowed, giving up just 16.3 points per game, but the offense struggled to score in several games.  MSU lost a 12\\xe2\\x80\\x9310 decision to Michigan, despite the defense keeping the Wolverines out of the end zone the entire game. In May 2013, four months after the end of the 2012 season, Dantonio filmed himself at the Rose Bowl, predicting a successful 2013.\\n_START_SECTION_\\n2013 season\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nIn 2013, Dantonio\\'s team finished 11\\xe2\\x80\\x931 in the regular season, including notable victories over Michigan (29\\xe2\\x80\\x936) and Nebraska (41\\xe2\\x80\\x9328) to secure the third and final Legends Division title. On December 7, 2013, Michigan State, ranked #10 at the time of the game, defeated second-ranked Ohio State 34\\xe2\\x80\\x9324 in the Big Ten Championship Game in Indianapolis. The win snapped Ohio State\\'s 24-game winning streak and sent Michigan State to its first Rose Bowl since the 1987\\xe2\\x80\\x9388 season. Michigan State was ranked #4 in the final BCS standings, its highest rank since the BCS\\'s inception. The Spartans defeated the fifth-ranked Stanford Cardinal 24\\xe2\\x80\\x9320 in the 100th Rose Bowl Game on January 1, 2014. Dantonio was named Big Ten Football Coach of the Year.\\n_START_SECTION_\\n2014 season\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nIn 2014, the Spartans finished the regular season 10\\xe2\\x80\\x932, finishing second in the East division with a 7\\xe2\\x80\\x931 record and ranked #8 in the nation. After losing to third-ranked Oregon in the season\\'s second game, the Spartans reeled off nine wins in their next 10 games. The Spartans earned a bid to the Goodyear Cotton Bowl Classic, part of the New Year\\'s Six bowls, and rallied from 20 points down in the fourth quarter to defeat fifth-ranked Baylor 42\\xe2\\x80\\x9341 and finish the season with an overall record of 11\\xe2\\x80\\x932. The two losses came against Oregon and Ohio State, the teams that would play in the 2015 College Football Playoff National Championship. After the Cotton Bowl game, Dantonio said \"It\\'s a feeling of belief in each other, and that\\'s what we have. We don\\'t give up on each other. Consequently, they don\\'t give up in the game. We just keep playing hard.

The typical rates of transition between the Markov states are the probability p per unit time of being infected with the virus, w for the rate of window period removal (time until virus is detectable), q for quit/loss rate from the system, and d for detection, assuming a typical rate at which the health system administers tests of the blood product or patients in question._NEWLINE_It follows that we can \"walk along\" the Markov model to identify the overall probability of detection for a person starting as undetected, by multiplying the probabilities of transition to each next state of the model as:_NEWLINE_._NEWLINE_The subsequent total absolute number of false negative tests\\xe2\\x80\\x94the primary CDC concern\\xe2\\x80\\x94would then be the rate of tests, multiplied by the probability of reaching the infected but undetectable state, times the duration of staying in the infected undetectable state:_NEWLINE_.'</td>\n",

His father, Saul Kamen, was a dentist, and his mother, Helen, was a teacher. He was of Jewish heritage._NEWLINE_While attending The High School of Music & Art in New York City, Michael Kamen became friends with Martin Fulterman (later known as Mark Snow, who composed the theme music for The X-Files among other projects). While studying the oboe, he formed a rock-classical fusion band called New York Rock & Roll Ensemble, together with classmates Fulterman and Dorian Rudnytsky along with Clifton Nivison and Brian Corrigan of Toms River, New Jersey. The group released five albums from 1968 to 1972 (Self-Titled, Reflections, Faithful Friends, Roll Over & Freedomburger). The group performed in white tie (not tuxedos), as typically worn by classical musicians. In the middle of the concert, Fulterman and Kamen would play an oboe duet. The group backed up friend and classmate Janis Ian in a concert at Alice Tully Hall in late 1967._NEWLINE_After graduating from high school, Kamen attended The Juilliard School, in Manhattan, New York City._NEWLINE_Kamen\\'s early work concentrated on ballets, before extending to Hollywood with the score for The Next Man in 1976, and then to pop and rock arranging, collaborating with Pink Floyd on their album, The Wall.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nCareer in popular music\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nKamen became a highly sought-after arranger in the realms of pop and rock music. His contemporaries in this field included Academy Award winner Anne Dudley, Richard Niles, and Nick Ingman._NEWLINE_His successes include his work with Pink Floyd, David Gilmour and Roger Waters (he is one of the few people invited to work with both former Pink Floyd members, even after their acrimonious split), as well as Queen (orchestration on Who Wants To Live Forever), Eric Clapton (on Edge of Darkness), Roger Daltrey, Aerosmith (live orchestral version of Dream On for MTV), Tom Petty, Bon Jovi, David Bowie, Bryan Ferry, Eurythmics, Queensr\\xc3\\xbfche, Rush, Metallica (on the song \"Nothing Else Matters\" and their live album, S&M), Def Leppard, Herbie Hancock, Tim Curry, The Cranberries, Bryan Adams, Jim Croce, Coldplay, Sting, Guns N\\' Roses (on their performance of November Rain on the MTV Video Music Awards) and Kate Bush. For Bush, Kamen delivered an orchestral backing for \"Moments of Pleasure\" from The Red Shoes album, substantially building upon a simple piano theme Bush had composed. In this instance and many others, he conducted the orchestra personally for the recording. In 1984, two years after moving to London, Kamen had similarly heightened the effect of a pop recording for the Eurythmics \"Here Comes the Rain Again\", that score relying as much on his compositional skills as his arranging talents._NEWLINE_In 1990, Kamen joined many other guests for Roger Waters\\' performance of The Wall in Berlin, and led the National Philharmonic Orchestra during the 24 Nights sessions with Eric Clapton the following year._NEWLINE_Lenny Kravitz recorded a cover of \"Fields of Joy\" on his 1991 CD Mama Said that Kamen had co-written with Hal Fredricks._NEWLINE_In 2002, Kamen took part in the Concert for George as strings conductor._NEWLINE_Kamen had a successful partnership with Bryan Adams and R.J. Lange composing scores and songs. The ballad \"(Everything I Do) I Do It for You\" for the 1991 film Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves was the number one song that year worldwide. Other songs were \"All for Love\" for the movie The Three Musketeers in 1993, and \"Have You Ever Really Loved a Woman?\" the song from the film Don Juan DeMarco, in 1994.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nFilm and television career\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nKamen wrote eleven ballets, a saxophone concerto and an electric guitar concerto  (with Japanese guitarist Tomoyasu Hotei as a soloist, though originally performed by Eric Clapton).

According to a legend, the icon was written by St.Luke the Evangelist and for long years it was an ancestral relic of Greek emperors in Constantinople. It is believed that a niece of the last Byzantine Emperor, Sophia Palaiologina who married the Great Prince of Muscovy Ivan III of Moscow, brought the icon to Moscow. While unconfirmed, there exists another version that the icon was transferred to the Great Prince of Moscow from prince of Halych who received it sometime ago as a present from Byzantine Emperors. Regardless of its past history, the fact states that Ivan III blessed his daughter Helena of Moscow with the icon when he gave her out in marriage for the Great Prince of Lithuania Alexander Jagiellon. The icon was brought to the capital of Grand Duchy of Lithuania and received name of Vilna. In 1866 during restoration, it was discovered that the top level is egg based tempera paint indicating very old origin of the icon. In 1915 at times of World War I during evacuation the icon was taken away from Vilnius and to this day location of Theotokos of Vilnius is unknown.\"</td>\n",

It is the oldest permanent settlement in New England._NEWLINE_Its commanding position at the mouth of the Penobscot River estuary, a lucrative source of furs and timber, as well as a major transportation route into the interior, made the peninsula of particular interest to European powers in the 17th century. Majabagaduce (as the Abenaki name would be corrupted) changed hands numerous times with shifting imperial politics. At one time or another, it was occupied by the French, Dutch and England's Plymouth Colony.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nLa Tour\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nCastine was founded in the winter of 1613, when Claude de Saint-\\xc3\\x89tienne de la Tour established a small trading post to conduct business with the Tarrantine Indians (now called the Penobscots)._NEWLINE_After the trading post was established at Castine, a raid by English captain Samuel Argall at Mount Desert Island in 1613 signaled the start of a long-running dispute over the boundary between French Acadia to the north and the English colonies to the south. There is evidence that La Tour immediately challenged the English action by re-establishing his trading post in the wake of Argall's raid.  Captain John Smith charted the area in 1614 and referred to French traders in the vicinity. In 1625, Charles de Saint-\\xc3\\x89tienne de la Tour erected a fort named Fort Pentagou\\xc3\\xabt._NEWLINE_English colonists from the Plymouth Colony seized it in 1629, and made it an administrative outpost of their colony. Colonial Governor William Bradford personally traveled there to claim it.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nAulnay\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nFrom 1635 to 1654, Charles de Menou d'Aulnay de Charnisay defended his private commercial interests at Fort Pentagoet. In 1635, it was retaken by the French and again incorporated into Acadia; Governor Isaac de Razilly sent Charles de Menou d'Aulnay de Charnisay to retake the village. In 1638, Aulnay built a more substantial fort named Fort Saint-Pierre. While he had other ventures in Acadia, Fort Pentagoet was his major outpost on the frontier with New England. Emmanuel Le Borgne with 100 men raided the settlement in 1653._NEWLINE_Major General Robert Sedgwick led 100 New England volunteers and 200 of Oliver Cromwell's soldiers on an expedition against Acadia in 1654. Before taking its capital Port Royal, Sedgwick captured and plundered the French settlement at Pentagou\\xc3\\xabt. The English occupied Acadia for the next 16 years and Fort Pentagou\\xc3\\xabt saw very little use.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nCapital of Acadia\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nFrom 1670, when Acadia was returned to the French, Fort Pentagou\\xc3\\xabt became the Capital of Acadia under two Governors Hector d'Andign\\xc3\\xa9 de Grandfontaine (1670\\xe2\\x80\\x9373) and Jacques de Chambly (1673-74), both formerly of the Carignan-Sali\\xc3\\xa8res Regiment. (Saint-Castin had already set up his near-by trading post three years earlier in 1667)._NEWLINE_During the Franco-Dutch War (1674), Pentagou\\xc3\\xabt and other Acadian ports were captured by the Dutch captain Jurriaen Aernoutsz who arrived from New Amsterdam, renaming Acadia, New Holland. The Dutch turned the fort's cannon on its own walls and destroyed most of it after the second siege. Saint-Castin himself retook it in 1676 and renamed the town Bagaduce, a shortened version of Majabagaduce.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nThe Habitation of Saint-Castine\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nFrom 1667, after the Treaty of Breda, until 1700, Saint-Castin, former ensign at Fort Pentagoet, re-established French authority nearby at a small trading post that formed a nucleus of a new French and Indian habitation. French authorities dispatched the Baron Jean-Vincent de Saint-Castin to take command of Pentagou\\xc3\\xabt. The baron married an Abenaki woman, the daughter of the sachem Modockawando. She adopted the French name Mathilde and bore him 10 children. The baron became a widower and then married another Abenaki woman named Marie Pidiwammiskwa who bore him two additional children. Castine soon became a force in colonial trade and diplomacy._NEWLINE_After 1677, Saint-Castin returned to his trading post within a village of 160 Etchemin Indians - two European buildings within a settlement of thirty-two wigwams.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nKing William's War\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nDuring King William's War, Castin's settlement was plundered by English Governor Sir Edmund Andros in 1688. In response, Saint-Castin led an Abenaki war party to raid the English settlement at Pemaquid (present-day Bristol, Maine) in August 1689. During the Siege of Pemaquid (1689), one of the captives the Maliseet took back to their main village, Meductic, was John Gyles, who created one of the few captivity narratives to come out of Nova Scotia/Acadia. John Gyles' brother James was also captured by the Penobscot and eventually taken back to Fort Penobscot where he was tortured and burned alive at the stake._NEWLINE_In 1692 the village was again seized by the English, when Major Benjamin Church destroyed the fort and looted the settlement. With the return of Baron de Saint-Castin and his sons to France, the settlement became sparsely occupied.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nQueen Anne's War\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nDuring Queen Anne's War, in response to the French Raid on Deerfield in February 1704, New England Colonel Benjamin Church raided Castin's settlement (then known as Penobscot) before moving on to raid other Acadian villages at present-day St. Stephen, New Brunswick, Grand Pr\\xc3\\xa9, Pisiguit (present-day Windsor, Nova Scotia), and Chignecto.  St. Castin's daughter was taken in the raid.\"</td>\n",

His father was a victim of the repressions of Joseph Stalin and was incarcerated in one of Stalin\\'s camps, and his mother was a cleaner and laundress. From 1945\\xc2\\xa0\\xe2\\x80\\x93 1952 he studied Secondary School \\xe2\\x84\\x96 22 in Ivanovo. As his father was deemed by the State to be an Enemy of the people, Zaitsev was denied the opportunity to study at an industrial academy, a theatrical school and a pilot training school._NEWLINE_In 1952 he began studies in the Faculty of Applied Arts at the University of Chemistry and Technology in Ivanovo, and during this time he became interested in manufacturing and received the credentials to become a textile artist. He graduated, with honours, from the university in 1956. After realising that working with textiles was his dream, he moved to Moscow in 1956, and commenced studies at the Moscow Textile Institute, from which he graduated in 1962 with a Bachelor\\'s degree in painting and designing. Whilst he was studying at the Institute, he married Marina Vladimirovna Zaitseva in 1959, and fathered a son, Yegor Vyacheslavovich Zaitsev, in 1960.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nCareer in the Soviet Union\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nDuring the Soviet era, clothing was dominated by Zaitsev and Valentin Yudashkin, and he was compared to other world-renowned fashion designers such as Christian Lacroix, Christian Dior, Pierre Cardin, and Yves Saint Laurent, Zaitsev was seen as being to compete with Western designers, however, under the communist regime, the only country outside of the USSR where Zaitsev was able to work was Czechoslovakia. Alexandre Vassiliev, a Russian-born, Paris-based fashion historian and designer, stated that \"(i)f he had had a chance to show his collections abroad he would have been most possibly a world-famed brand.\"_NEWLINE_In March 1962, he began work as the artistic director of \\xc2\\xabExperimental technical garment factory \\xc2\\xabMosoblsovnarkhoza\\xc2\\xbb, where he oversaw production of women\\'s clothing for retail stores in Moscow and the surrounding region. Zaitsev came to attention in 1963 when he designed a chic version of the telogreika, Pavlovsky Posad shawl-inspired skirts and multi-coloured valenki for kolkhoz workers. Whilst his creations were lauded by the authorities for \"sparkling with all colours of the rainbow\", his collection was not approved for production by the Methodical Council. In February 1963, Paris Match became the first foreign media outlet to profile Zaitsev, and highly rated his collection._NEWLINE_In March 1965 Zaitsev became the Chief Designer at the All-Union Fashion House, which was also known as Dom Modeli, on Kuznetsky Most. In April 1965 Pierre Cardin, Marc Bohan (then with Dior) and Guy Laroche visited Moscow and became familiar with Zaitsev\\'s works, although Zaitsev wasn\\'t present, and was covered in an article of Paris Match. Pierre Cardin called Zaitsev an \"equal among equals\", and the French press dubbed him the Red Dior Between 1965\\xc2\\xa0\\xe2\\x80\\x93 1968 Zaitsev\\'s works, dubbed the Russian series, were displayed abroad._NEWLINE_He resigned from the All-Union Fashion House in 1978, and began to work out of a small studio. His mother, with whom he had a great affinity died in the same year, and after her death he took up the writing of poetry. Zaitsev designed a collection of costumes for the Soviet team for the 1980 Summer Olympics which were held in Moscow, for which he was awarded the Order of the Badge of Honor. He authored two books in 1980, \"Such Changeable Fashion\" (Russian: \\xd0\\xa2\\xd0\\xb0\\xd0\\xba\\xd0\\xb0\\xd1\\x8f \\xd0\\xb8\\xd0\\xb7\\xd0\\xbc\\xd0\\xb5\\xd0\\xbd\\xd1\\x87\\xd0\\xb8\\xd0\\xb2\\xd0\\xb0\\xd1\\x8f \\xd0\\xbc\\xd0\\xbe\\xd0\\xb4\\xd0\\xb0) and \"This Multifaceted World of Fashion\" (Russian: \\xd0\\xad\\xd1\\x82\\xd0\\xbe\\xd1\\x82 \\xd0\\xbc\\xd0\\xbd\\xd0\\xbe\\xd0\\xb3\\xd0\\xbe\\xd0\\xbb\\xd0\\xb8\\xd0\\xba\\xd0\\xb8\\xd0\\xb9 \\xd0\\xbc\\xd0\\xb8\\xd1\\x80 \\xd0\\xbc\\xd0\\xbe\\xd0\\xb4\\xd1\\x8b), which were republished in Bulgaria and Czechoslovakia in 1983._NEWLINE_In 1982 he transformed his studio into the \\xc2\\xabSlava Zaitsev\\xc2\\xbb Moscow Fashion House (Russian: \\xc2\\xab\\xd0\\x9c\\xd0\\xbe\\xd1\\x81\\xd0\\xba\\xd0\\xbe\\xd0\\xb2\\xd1\\x81\\xd0\\xba\\xd0\\xb8\\xd0\\xb9 \\xd0\\x94\\xd0\\xbe\\xd0\\xbc \\xd0\\x9c\\xd0\\xbe\\xd0\\xb4\\xd1\\x8b \\xd0\\x92\\xd1\\x8f\\xd1\\x87\\xd0\\xb5\\xd1\\x81\\xd0\\xbb\\xd0\\xb0\\xd0\\xb2\\xd0\\xb0 \\xd0\\x97\\xd0\\xb0\\xd0\\xb9\\xd1\\x86\\xd0\\xb5\\xd0\\xb2\\xd0\\xb0\\xc2\\xbb), also known as Dom Modi, becoming the first Soviet couturier who was permitted by the Soviet Government to label his own clothing. By the mid-1980s, Dom Modi employed 600 civil servants and was required to produce some 2 million rubles worth of clothing each year. In 1984 it was reported that Dom Modi had served 10,000 customers, and prices ranged from US$170 to US$260 for pr\\xc3\\xaat-\\xc3\\xa0-porter dresses, and up to US$1000 for haute couture gowns. Zaitsev met with Thierry Mugler in 1985 in Moscow, and the French couturier photographed Zaitsev\\'s fashions for an article in Paris Match._NEWLINE_Raisa Gorbachyova wore Zaitsev creations when she made what The New York Times described as a \"perestroika splash\" in the 1980s. Due to the patronage of the Soviet First Lady, he gained a reputation as one of the world\\'s hottest fashion designers, and became an international celebrity in his own right and a household name in Russia. Zaitsev fashions were displayed at Expo \\'85 in Tsukuba, Japan, although it wasn\\'t until 1986 when he was able to visit a capitalist country when he displayed some of his works in the Soviet pavilion at Expo 86 in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada._NEWLINE_A member of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, Zaitsev affirmed his belief in the Soviet Union and the future of communism, including the communist ideals of a workers\\' paradise. The New York Times reported that by the 1980s, he became disillusioned with the Party. Zaitsev told the newspaper that at mandatory party meetings he \"began to defend the right to be free, as it says in the Communist charter. They constantly tried to distract me, not to let me get in. I\\'d be stuck in the elevator or I\\'d be sent off to some other event.\" This disillusionment led to Zaitsev quitting the party in the late 1980s._NEWLINE_Zaitsev often complained to the Soviet authorities about the lack of essential materials for his craft, which The New York Times noted in 1988 that he \"until recently\" was forced to use dressmaker\\'s mannequins from World War II. Zaitsev signed a three-year contract with Intertorg Inc. in August 1987, which saw Dom Modi selling its designs in the United States, with profits going to the design house rather than the Soviet Treasury. The contract was the first commercial consumer venture signed between the two countries. In October 1987 he showed his collection at the iconic Waldorf-Astoria in New York City, which critics called overwrought, out-of-date and reminiscent of Western fashion from several seasons earlier. Undiscouraged, Zaitsev said that he planned to return with a \"pared-down, sexier collection\". He returned to New York City in 1988 where he designed costumes for the musical revue Sophisticated Ladies, based on the music of Duke Ellington. Participation in his first Paris fashion shows came in January 1988 at the invitation of Madame Carven, whom Zaitsev met in Moscow in December 1987, showing his collection under the banner of \"Russian Seasons\". He also joined the Maison de Couture and was made an honorary citizen of Paris, by then Mayor Jacques Chirac. The following year in March, Maison de Couture named Zaitsev as \"Man of the Year in the World of Fashion\"_NEWLINE_In September 1989, Zaitsev showed his collections in West Germany for the first time under the theme \"Fashion and Music Revue \\'90\", and in December 1989 he won first prize at \"Five top fashion designers in the world-90\" in Tokyo, Japan, where he was competing against Donna Karan, Claude Montana, Hanae Mori and Byblos.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nCareer in Russia\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nWhilst during the Soviet era Zaitsev\\'s work was funded by the Soviet government, which as a state employee he earned the maximum of 1,000 rubles per month, after the collapse of the Soviet Union he became responsible for financing the business out of his private income, with New Russians making up the bulk of his clientele. In 1991 he designed a new uniform for the Russian police, and was bestowed the title of Honored Worker in the Field of the Arts. By 1992, Jane Fonda, Ted Turner and Herb Ritts were amongst celebrities who became customers of Zaitsev, and in the same year Zaitsev launched a women\\'s perfume named Maroussia, in conjunction with French-based L\\'Or\\xc3\\xa9al. The perfume which is classified as a floral oriental and is still in production, was launched in a few European countries in 1992 and was launched worldwide in 1993._NEWLINE_1992 was also a significant year in Zaitsev\\'s career, because it was then that he presented for the first time his recent fashion collection, as well as his paintings and works on paper in prestigious venues, both in New York and in Beverly Hills. Never before was Russian fashion design demonstrated on the American runways, and never before were Zaitsev\\'s most personal paintings and drawings allowed to be exhibited in the West. Fashion shows and exhibitions were held at the Bowles-Sorokko Galleries on both the East and the West Coasts, and they were widely attended, marking the beginning of cultural exchanges in the area of visual arts between the USA and the new Russia. According to Serge Sorokko, then president of the Bowles-Sorokko Galleries, Mr. Zaitsev was a lifelong painter, but was never free to exhibit publicly his art before. \"[That was] because his work was outside the dogmas of socialist realism,\" Mr. Sorokko told The New York Times. \"He was permitted to paint only for his own soul. When I visited his home in Moscow, I saw 20 years of pictorial work on his walls.\"_NEWLINE_In 1994, Zaitsev hosted the inaugural Nadezhda Lamanova Prize competition for professional Russian designers at Dom Modi, and the competition has been held under his patronage since. In 1996 he launched a competition in Russia, using the slogan of \"Goodbye Barbie, welcome Maroussia\", to find the \"purest essence of\" female adolescence, with the aim of decreasing the influence of the American doll in Russia. In Zaitsev\\'s words, \"Barbie is rigid, cold, cynical, pragmatic. Now look at the faces of our children... they are not only beautiful, but sweet, charming and mysterious. In every face there\\'s a secret, and so must the new Russian doll\". Also in 1996, a follow-up to 1992s Maroussia, a floriental fragrance named Authentic Maroussia was launched but has since been discontinued._NEWLINE_Zaitsev was the tailor to Vladimir Zhirinovsky for his 1996 Russian presidential campaign. Zaitsev, who planned to vote for Boris Yeltsin, stated on Zhirinovsky, \"He wanted something distinctly Russian, so I thought back to the military-style jackets of the 20s, the 30s\\xe2\\x80\\x94like Stalin, only in new colours\". On 27 May 1996, President of Russia Boris Yeltsin awarded Zaitsev the State Prize of the Russian Federation in the field of literature and the arts. In 1996, Zaitsev was also made an honorary citizen of the city of his birth, Ivanovo._NEWLINE_His 2001 collection entitled Dedication saw the most expensive dresses costing between $10,000\\xc2\\xa0\\xe2\\x80\\x93 12,000, whilst the cheapest were in the $2,000\\xc2\\xa0\\xe2\\x80\\x93 3,000 price range._NEWLINE_When then-President of Russia Vladimir Putin was due to travel on a state visit to the United Kingdom in June 2003, Zaitsev designed attire for First Lady of Russia Lyudmila Putina to wear for the visit, which included an audience with Queen Elizabeth II. Zaitsev told Zhizn that it took some time to convince Putina to wear a hat, due to Russian women in general not wearing them._NEWLINE_By February 2005, Zaitsev had opened 4 \\xc2\\xab\\xd0\\xa1\\xd0\\xbb\\xd0\\xb0\\xd0\\xb2\\xd0\\xb0 \\xd0\\x97\\xd0\\xb0\\xd0\\xb9\\xd1\\x86\\xd0\\xb5\\xd0\\xb2.

The New York Times described Zaitsev in 2004 as one of the few Soviet icons who is still an icon in modern-day Russia, and Time Magazine reported in 2007 that the Zaitsev name has 93% brand awareness in Russia. In 2007 Kommersant commissioned VCIOM to run a poll on public perception as to the make-up of the Russian elite; Zaitsev, who is often referred to as the Patriarch of Russian fashion, was rated at 74._NEWLINE_Zaitsev is not interested in achieving worldwide renown by showing his creations abroad, preferring to stay true to his Russian roots and encourages other Russian designers not to be influenced by the West. Zaitsev was quoted by Women\\'s Wear Daily in April 2008 as saying:_NEWLINE_\"I think that as a Russian artist, I should show in Russia. At the beginning of the 1990s, I had the chance to show in Paris, and I realised that it\\'s not my place.\"_NEWLINE_In 2007 Zaitsev took part in the TV show \"Fashion Sentence\" (Russian: \\xd0\\x9c\\xd0\\xbe\\xd0\\xb4\\xd0\\xbd\\xd1\\x8b\\xd0\\xb9 \\xd0\\xbf\\xd1\\x80\\xd0\\xb8\\xd0\\xb3\\xd0\\xbe\\xd0\\xb2\\xd0\\xbe\\xd1\\x80) on Channel One, in which he acted as a judge passing down sentence on contestant\\'s fashion sense. After visiting Ashgabat in June 2008 for the Turkmen Textile Exhibition, Zaitsev stated that he was fascinated by traditional Turkmen clothing, and announced plans for a new collection which would incorporate traditional Turkmen elements. The casual wear collection is to be made exclusively from cotton from Turkmenistan and would feature the traditional Turkmen embroidery which captured his imagination. In September 2008, Zaitsev participated in \"The Russian Evening-2008\" at the Institute for International Political Studies in Milan, which was attended by Svetlana Medvedeva and Clio Maria Bittoni, the wife of Italian President Giorgio Napolitano._NEWLINE_Zaitsev has always been an admirer of the costumes sketches supplied by Pablo Picasso and Albert Benois, amongst others, for Sergei Diaghilev\\'s Paris troupe, and to celebrate the 100th anniversary of Diaghilev\\'s Ballets Russes, Zaitsev\\'s collection for the 2009 Russian Fashion Week pays homage to the Russian ballet impresario._NEWLINE_The Eremitage in Sankt Petersburg honors since June 2016 Zaitsev\\'s work with an extensive exhibition of his work. The new exhibition will be a big step toward creating a costume museum at the world-famous Eremitage.

In 2004, the New York Times stated, \"(i)t is her stolid image that he has been dressing all these years in flounces and feathers, poufs and peplums, gold and glitter.\" During the Soviet era, he regularly complained that he designed collections for the \"larger\" woman in the 1970s, but only models up to size 48 were accepted for production._NEWLINE_Whilst Zaitsev regards fashion designers Coco Chanel, Christian Dior, Gianfranco Ferr\\xc3\\xa9 and Hubert de Givenchy as idols, his own creations are strongly influenced by traditional Russian and Slavic styles, and his collections include a variety of theme-based shows reflecting his take on the industry at the time. Past collections include the Millennium of the Christianisation of Russia in 1988; Russian Seasons in Paris in 1988; Agony of Perestroika in 1991; and Recollections of the Future in 1996\\xc2\\xa0\\xe2\\x80\\x93 1997.

The challenge has been adopted by the New Zealand national rugby union team, the \"All Blacks\", and a number of other New Zealand national teams perform before their international matches; some non-New Zealand sports teams have also adopted the haka.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nHistory\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nDuring 1888\\xe2\\x80\\x9389, the New Zealand Native team toured the Home Nations of the United Kingdom, the first team from a colony to do so. It was originally intended that only M\\xc4\\x81ori players would be selected, but four non-M\\xc4\\x81ori were finally included. As the non-M\\xc4\\x81ori were born in New Zealand, the name \"Native\" was considered justified. The team performed a haka before the start of their first match on 3 October 1888 against Surrey. They were described as using the words \"Ake ake kia kaha\" which suggests that the haka was not \"Ka Mate\". It was intended that before each match they would perform the haka dressed in traditional M\\xc4\\x81ori costume but the costumes were soon discarded._NEWLINE_The \"Ka Mate\" haka was not well known at this time. In 1900, a newspaper reported New Zealand soldiers in the Boer War chanting \"Ka Mate! Ka Mate! Ka ora! Ka ora! Hae-haea! Ha!\" The soldiers thought it meant \"Kill him! Chop him up! Baste him!\"_NEWLINE_But during the 1901 Royal Tour, Ngati Kahungunu warriors revived \"Ka Mate\" when they performed it to welcome the Duke of Cornwall at Rotorua. Newspapers described the full actions of this \"ancient ngeri\", printing its complete Maori words and an accurate translation. A movie cameraman recorded the performance. \"Ka Mate\" became famous, and was widely performed throughout New Zealand._NEWLINE_Nevertheless, when New Zealand played its first full international test match against Australia in Sydney in August 1903, the New Zealanders\\' war cry was \"Tena Koe Kangaroo.\" (full details below)_NEWLINE_In 1905 New Zealand made their first tour of Britain. This was the first time the team were referred to as the All Blacks and this particular team also became known as the \\'Originals\\'. It is uncertain whether they performed a haka before every match, but they at least performed \"Ka Mate\" before their first test, against Scotland, and before the match against Wales. The Welsh crowd, led by the Welsh team, responded by singing the Welsh national anthem._NEWLINE_When a New Zealand Army team played Wales in 1916, the words of \"Ka Mate\" were included in the printed programme, indicating that the haka was established as an accompaniment to New Zealand rugby teams playing overseas._NEWLINE_The 1924\\xe2\\x80\\x9325 New Zealand rugby team which toured the United Kingdom, Irish Free State, France and Canada and which was nicknamed the Invincibles, performed a haka that was written for them during the voyage to England by two supporters, Judge Frank Acheson of the Native Land Court and Wiremu Rangi of Gisborne. The haka was led by star player George Nepia. It was performed before all but two of the tour matches. Reporters criticised the team for disappointing the crowd on the two occasions it was not performed._NEWLINE_A pre-match haka was not always performed on All Blacks tours. The team that toured Britain in 1935\\xe2\\x80\\x9336 did not perform one before matches, although they did some impromptu performances at social functions. In the early decades, haka were only rarely performed at home matches, such as the third test of the 1921 Springboks tour, played in Wellington.\\n_START_SECTION_\\n\"Ka Mate\"\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nThe All Blacks are believed to have first performed a choreographed and synchronized version of the \"Ka Mate\" haka in 1905._NEWLINE_It is said that this Haka was composed by Te Rauparaha of Ng\\xc4\\x81ti Toa to commemorate his escape from death during an incident in 1810. Chased by his enemies, he hid in a food-storage pit under the skirt of a woman. He climbed out to find someone standing over him, who, instead of killing Te Rauparaha, turned out to be another chief friendly to him. In relief, Te Rauparaha performed this ancient haka, which had been performed all through Aotearoa for centuries. The story of Te Rauparaha was merely woven into several older stories about this haka.\\n_START_SECTION_\\n\"Ko Niu Tireni\" 1924\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nThe Invincibles performed this haka during their unbeaten 1924\\xe2\\x80\\x931925 tour.

It featured an extended and aggressive introduction by team captain Tana Umaga highlighted by a drawing of the thumb down the throat. This was interpreted by many as a \"throat-slitting\" action directed at the opposing team. The All Blacks went on to win the match 31 to 27._NEWLINE_The words to \"Kapa o Pango\" are more specific to the rugby team than \"Ka Mate\", referring to the warriors in black and the silver fern._NEWLINE__NEWLINE_The new haka was developed by Derek Lardelli of Ng\\xc4\\x81ti Porou by modifying the first verse of \"Ko Niu Tirini,\" the haka used by the 1924 All Blacks. An NZRU press release stated that_NEWLINE_Kapa o Pango has been over a year in the making, and was created in consultation with many experts in M\\xc4\\x81ori culture. It will serve as a complement to \"Ka Mate\" rather than a replacement, to be used for \\'special occasions\\'.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nResponses and controversies\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nThe haka, while normally enjoyed by spectators, has been criticised as an unsporting attempt to intimidate the opposition before the match begins.  However, most teams accept that the haka is part of rugby\\'s heritage and face up to the All Blacks during its performance, with both teams standing about 10 metres apart. The 2007 Portuguese Rugby team Captain Vasco Uva said of the haka that \"[We] faced it, gave it the respect it deserved and it gave us motivation and we knew if it gave them strength, it was also a point of strength for us.\"_NEWLINE_Ignoring the haka is a tactic sometimes used by opposing teams. Famously, the Australian rugby team did a warm up drill well away from the All Blacks during their 1996 test match in Wellington. More recently, the Italian rugby team ignored the haka during a 2007 World Cup Pool Match. All Black team member, Keven Mealamu, said later that in his opinion the snub had backfired and provided motivation to his team._NEWLINE_Australian back David Campese often ignored the haka, most notably in the 1991 World Cup semi-final victory over the All Blacks, when he chose to practice warm-up drills instead of facing the All Blacks._NEWLINE_In 1989, as the All Blacks were performing the haka in Lansdowne Road before playing Ireland, the Irish lined up in a tight V formation to facing New Zealand and then edged closer and closer to the All Blacks. By the time the end of the haka came, captain Willie Anderson was only inches from Buck Shelford\\'s face._NEWLINE_In 1997, Richard Cockerill was disciplined for responding to the haka before the start of an England vs. All Blacks game. Cockerill went toe-to-toe with his opposite number Norm Hewitt while they performed the haka. The referee became so concerned that Hewitt and Cockerill would begin fighting that he pushed Cockerill away from Hewitt. Cockerill went on to say afterwards \"I believe that I did the right thing that day,\" he said. \"They were throwing down a challenge and I showed them I was ready to accept it. I\\'m sure they would rather we did that than walk away.\" In recent times when the haka is performed against England, it is often drowned out by England fans singing \"Swing Low, Sweet Chariot\"._NEWLINE_In 2005, the All Blacks agreed to a request from the Welsh Rugby Union to repeat the sequence of events from the original match a century before in 1905. This involved the All Blacks performing the haka after \"God Defend New Zealand\" and before \"Hen Wlad fy Nhadau\". For the November 2006 test, the Welsh Rugby Union demanded a repeat of this sequence. The All Blacks refused, and instead chose to perform the haka in their changing room before the match. All Blacks captain Richie McCaw defended the decision by stating that the haka was \"integral to New Zealand culture and the All Blacks\\' heritage\" and \"if the other team wants to mess around, we\\'ll just do the haka in the shed\". The crowd reacted negatively to the lack of the haka and then being shown brief footage of the haka on the screens at the Millennium Stadium._NEWLINE_In 2006, the Seven Network TV channel in Australia aired a commercial which used digital enhancement to add handbags to video of New Zealand rugby players performing the haka. This was inspired by an incident when former All Black captain Tana Umaga struck Hurricanes teammate Chris Masoe over the head with a woman\\'s handbag after the Super 14 final. All Blacks assistant coach Wayne Smith criticised the advertisement, saying \"It is insensitive, I think, to M\\xc4\\x81ori and disrespectful of the All Blacks\"._NEWLINE_The \"Kapa o Pango\" haka created controversy when the gesture of a thumb drawn down the throat was interpreted by many observers as implying throat slitting. The All Blacks and M\\xc4\\x81ori interpreted it as drawing the breath of life into the heart and lungs (\"hauora\"). This led to calls for it to be banned, although a poll conducted in July 2006 showed 60 percent support in New Zealand. During Ireland\\'s tour of New Zealand, the NZRU put the haka on a temporary hiatus, to review its appropriateness, by asking the All Blacks not to perform it against Ireland._NEWLINE_In the 2007 Rugby World Cup quarter-finals, France, after having won the coin toss for the choice of uniforms, famously wore the blue/white/red of the French flag and walked up to within a metre of the haka performance, forming a line of opposition to the performance by the All Blacks, who were wearing a predominantly silver uniform (as opposed to the traditional all black). France went on to beat the All Blacks 20\\xe2\\x80\\x9318._NEWLINE_In the 2008 Rugby Autumn Tests, Wales responded to the haka by standing on the pitch refusing to move until the All Blacks did. This resulted in the referee Jonathan Kaplan berating both teams for a full two minutes after the haka had ended until eventually New Zealand captain McCaw instructed his team to break off. After a spirited first half display which ended with Wales leading 9\\xe2\\x80\\x936, the All Blacks responded positively and won the game 9\\xe2\\x80\\x9329._NEWLINE_Following the final of the 2011 World Cup, the French national team was fined by the IRB for marching to within 10 metres of their All Black opponents during the performance of the haka. To many, this has been viewed as an insult from the IRB.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nUse by other teams\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nOther New Zealand sports teams have similarly performed the haka before a match. The tradition of performing a haka before every test match is just as strong with the Kiwis, the New Zealand national rugby league team, performing it before every game. Traditionally they performed the \"Ka Mate\" haka, but starting at the 2013 Rugby League World Cup they perform a team-specific haka called \"Te Iwi Kiwi\". It is also performed by the Australian rules football team and Tall Blacks. The New Zealand M\\xc4\\x81ori have performed the \\'Timatanga\\' haka since 2001. In the documentary Murderball, the New Zealand paralympic rugby team can be seen performing a modified version of the haka._NEWLINE_When Munster hosted the All Blacks at Thomond Park, Limerick in November 2008, the four New Zealand players in the Munster team performed their own haka prior to the All Blacks._NEWLINE_At the opening parade of the 2002 Commonwealth Games in Manchester, the New Zealand team_NEWLINE_stopped in front of the Queen and performed a haka._NEWLINE_New Zealand teams have attracted some criticism for performing the haka,_NEWLINE_on occasions such as winning a swim relay bronze medal._NEWLINE_In 2009, Ice Blacks did their haka before their ice hockey match against Australia. The Tall Blacks performed the dance prior to its games in the 2014 FIBA tournament, including a contest against the United States, where video of the dance was widely circulated and sparked discussion._NEWLINE_The Black Sticks, the (field) hockey team, also perform a haka._NEWLINE_The high-profile of the All Blacks, and their use of the haka has led other Pacific teams to use similar dances from their own cultures, such as the Cibi, Kailao, and Siva tau. Other teams from the Pacific and elsewhere however have performed the \"Ka Mate\" or \"Kapa o Pango\" haka. For instance, the \"Kapa o Pango\" haka was used by the University of Hawaii Warriors in 2006, before they created their own war dance, the \"Ha\\xca\\xbba\", in the Hawaiian language with original movements.'</td>\n",

He had a sister, Ilna. He joined the Army and was posted to Fort H. G. Wright, and then to the area prep school at Fort Preble, Maine. He was accepted into the United States Military Academy at West Point, which he entered on 1 July 1937. The West Point Yearbook noted that he \"came to West Point from the Army with a determination to do his best in whatever he attempted. We can see from his record that his best was exceptional.\"_NEWLINE_Moody was ranked first in his class, which graduated and was commissioned as second lieutenants on 1 July 1941. Traditionally, the highest ranked graduates in the class joined the United States Army Corps of Engineers, but Moody chose to join the cavalry instead. He married Jean Enwright, whom he had known since childhood. They had four daughters, all with names starting with the letter J: Judith, Jean, Joan, and Joy.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nWorld War II\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nOn 1 August 1941, he assumed command of a platoon in Troop F, 14th Cavalry at Fort Riley, Kansas. He attended the United States Army Cavalry School from 3 October to 23 December 1941, shortly after the United States entered World War II, and was a platoon commander in Troop E, 6th Cavalry from 20 January to 15 May 1942. He returned to West Point as an instructor in Chemical and Electrical Engineering, where he was promoted to first lieutenant on 15 June 1942, captain on 15 December 1942, and major on 4 January 1944._NEWLINE_In May 1944, Moody was posted to the European Theater of Operations, where he served on the staff of SHAEF until 14 September 1944. He then returned to the United States, where he saw duty in Washington, D.C., with the Operations Division (OPD) of the War Department General Staff and in the China-Burma-India Theater. After attending the Command and General Staff School at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, from 8 January to 6 March 1945, he was posted to the Cavalry Replacement Training Center at Fort Riley, and then, on 9 July 1945, to the staff of the Central Pacific Base Command on Okinawa. On 15 August 1945, he became Assistant Chief of Staff (G-3) of the 7th Infantry Division, then also based on Okinawa, but which subsequently participated in the United States occupation of Korea after the war ended. He was promoted to lieutenant colonel on 15 March 1946, and was awarded the Bronze Star Medal for his services.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nLater life\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nMoody\\'s appointment as a lieutenant colonel in the Army of the United States was terminated on 31 May 1946, and he reverted to his substantive rank of first lieutenant in the cavalry. He became an instructor at Fort Knox, Kentucky, on 14 June 1947, and became a captain again on 1 July 1948. He attended Yale University, where he earned a Master of Arts degree in international relations in 1950. He was then posted back to The Pentagon for duty in the Office of the Chief of Staff of the Army. This was followed by a posting to the headquarters of the United States European Command in Paris, and then a tour as a tank battalion commander in Germany. In due course he returned to Fort Carson, Colorado. After graduating from the United States Army War College, he returned to the Office of the Chief of Staff of the Army, and then was posted to Korea, where he commanded a brigade._NEWLINE_The tour of command in Korea was cut short, and Moody returned to the United States for duty as the Military Assistant to Robert McNamara, the Secretary of Defense. He was promoted to brigadier general in July 1966. After learning how to fly helicopters at Fort Rucker, Alabama, he was appointed the Assistant Division Commander of the 1st Cavalry Division, then engaged in combat in Vietnam during the Vietnam War in March 1967._NEWLINE_Moody took up his new posting at the Camp Radcliff, in An Khe, Vietnam, but on 19 March 1967, just a week after he arrived, he said he was not feeling well, and asked for a doctor to be sent to his quarters. He died of a heart attack shortly after the doctor arrived. He was survived by his father, and his wife and four daughters. His body was returned to the United States, and he was buried in Arlington National Cemetery on 24 March 1967 with full military honors. His name was subsequently inscribed on the wall of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington, DC.

Gregory made his professional football debut in 1972, at the age of 18, when playing for Northampton Town. He scored eight goals in 187 games over the next five years, before being transferred to First Division Aston Villa in 1977._NEWLINE_Gregory was a considerable success at Aston Villa. Despite playing two divisions higher than he had ever done before, he adapted well to First Division football and scored 10 goals in 65 games over the next two seasons. During his time at Villa, Gregory became the only player to play in every outfield position, wearing every number from 2 to 11 over his two seasons with the club, which remains a record._NEWLINE_In 1979, Gregory signed for Brighton & Hove Albion, who had just won promotion to the First Division for the first time in their history. He scored seven goals in 72 games over the next two seasons before dropping down into the Second Division to sign for Queen's Park Rangers._NEWLINE_He was part of the QPR side that reached the FA Cup final in 1982 (losing to Tottenham Hotspur in a replay) and won promotion to the First Division a year later as Second Division champions. He also helped QPR finish fifth and qualify for the UEFA Cup in 1984, but 1984\\xe2\\x80\\x9385 was a tough season for Gregory and his colleagues after manager Terry Venables departed to Barcelona and successor Frank Sibley was unable to keep up QPR's good form. At the end of a difficult season in which QPR only narrowly stayed in the First Division, Gregory dropped down two divisions to sign for fallen giants Derby County._NEWLINE_Derby County, champions of England in 1972 and 1975, had fallen into the Third Division in 1984 and had failed to win promotion in 1984\\xe2\\x80\\x9385. Gregory was the centerpiece of their midfield as they achieved promotion to the Second Division at the end of the 1985\\xe2\\x80\\x9386 season and to the First Division (as Second Division champions) a year later. Gregory stayed for one season as Derby County survived their first top flight season for nearly a decade, before announcing his retirement as a player. He played a total of 93 league appearances for the Rams, scoring 22 goals._NEWLINE_When taking over as manager of Plymouth Argyle early in 1990, Gregory re-registered himself as a player and appeared three times for them in the Second Division. On departing from the Home Park club, he moved 300 miles north to play for Third Division Bolton Wanderers, making seven appearances before finally retiring as a player at the age of 36.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nManagerial career\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nHis first two spells in management (between January 1989 and June 1990), first with Portsmouth and then with Plymouth Argyle, lasted just a few months each. Shortly afterwards, he linked up as a non-contract player with his former England and Northampton Town teammate Phil Neal, who was then manager at Bolton Wanderers._NEWLINE_He later worked under Brian Little on the coaching staff at Leicester City (1991\\xe2\\x80\\x931994) and Aston Villa (1994\\xe2\\x80\\x9396) before moving back into management with Wycombe Wanderers in September 1996. Wycombe were bottom of Division Two when Gregory took over, but he oversaw a massive improvement in league form which saw the club climb up to a secure mid-table finish. However, the side he put together failed to progress any further, and they also suffered an embarrassing FA Cup exit to Basingstoke Town. Wycombe were performing well in February 1998 when Gregory quit to take the manager's job back at Aston Villa. He helped improve Villa's league form during the final 3 months of the 1997\\xe2\\x80\\x9398 season and they qualified for the UEFA Cup._NEWLINE_Halfway through the 1998\\xe2\\x80\\x9399 season, Villa were Premiership leaders but a slump in form saw the club eventually finish sixth in the final table and miss out on a first Premiership title. Villa reached the FA Cup final in 2000 but lost to Chelsea. Gregory quit in January 2002, with Villa going on to finish eighth that season._NEWLINE_Gregory's next spell in management was with Derby County (January 2002 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 March 2003). When he took charge at Derby they were bottom of the Premiership, but after winning both of his first two games at the helm it looked as though he might be able to save them from relegation. Unfortunately, seven defeats from their final eight fixtures saw Derby slip out of the Premiership after six years. The club's financial problems meant that Gregory hadn't purchased any players during the 2002\\xe2\\x80\\x9303 season, and their subsequent form in Division One was disappointing._NEWLINE_He was sacked in March 2003 for alleged misconduct but later won \\xc2\\xa31\\xc2\\xa0million in compensation for unfair dismissal. Due to the ongoing lawsuit, Gregory was unable to apply for another managerial position for some time, so he spent most of the next three years working as a television pundit._NEWLINE_On 20 September 2006 he was unveiled as manager of Queens Park Rangers. He replaced Gary Waddock, who had stepped down following a poor succession of results that had left the club bottom of the Football League Championship. This appointment caused a schism among QPR fans, some of whom saw Gregory's friendship with controversial chairman Gianni Paladini as a conflict of interest. After a decent start with successive victories over Hull City and Southampton, Rangers form dipped before winning three on the bounce (including a victory at (then) league leaders Cardiff City). Unfortunately, results did not continue to improve, and relegation looked a distinct possibility for Gregory's men. However, following a fine late season run, QPR beat Cardiff 1\\xe2\\x80\\x930 at Loftus Road on 21 April 2007 to secure their Championship status for another year. Gregory was sacked as QPR manager on 1 October 2007, after another string of poor performances._NEWLINE_On 8 December 2009, Gregory was appointed the manager of Israeli club Maccabi Ahi Nazareth. He led them to relegation._NEWLINE_On 18 May 2010, Gregory signed a 3-year contract with Israeli Premier League Club F.C. Ashdod. He resigned from Ashdod on 18 April 2011, with the club facing the possibility of relegation._NEWLINE_On 13 June 2011, Gregory was appointed the manager of Kazakh club FC Kairat from Almaty, Kazakhstan. Kairat survived relegation at the end of the 2011 season to the second tier of Kazakhstan football._NEWLINE_Gregory had his contract as manager of FC Kairat terminated in December 2011, and in April 2012 was paid $120,000 in compensation._NEWLINE_On 3 December 2013, Gregory was named as the manager of Crawley Town, replacing previous manager Richie Barker._NEWLINE_On 27 December 2014, after being Crawley Town manager for just over a year Gregory stepped down as manager due to health problems; on the same day Crawley Town named former Welsh international and former Wolverhampton Wanderers manager Dean Saunders as interim manager.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nChennaiyin\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nOn 3 July 2017, Gregory signed as head coach of Chennaiyin in the Indian Super League. _NEWLINE_On 17 March 2018, he led to Chennaiyin to their second Indian Super League title by defeating Bengaluru 2\\xe2\\x80\\x933 in the finals. On 19 March 2018, Gregory extended his contract for one year.\"</td>\n",

He fought also on the battlefields of World War I, but returned to Georgia after the February Revolution in 1917. He formed two national divisions and secured the capital Tbilisi from the chaotically retreating and increasingly Bolshevist Russian soldiers. In April 1918, he successfully defended the southwestern province Guria from the Ottoman offensive winning a victory on the Choloki River. In June 1918, he served as a governor general of Abkhazia and crushed there a pro-Bolshevik revolt; then he took Gagra, Sochi and Tuapse in the first phase of the Sochi conflict._NEWLINE_From October to December 1918, he served as a governor general of Tbilisi. During the December Georgian-Armenian war 1918, he was appointed a commander-in-chief and successfully defended the Georgian borders from the troops of General Dro. In 1919 he served as a governor general of Akhaltsikhe and Akhalkalaki and was moved, on 6 October 1920, as a commandant in Tbilisi. During the Soviet invasion of February 1921, he repulsed the Red Army from the Soghanlughi heights at the outskirts of Tbilisi. The war, however, was lost.

The athach appeared as a player character race and class in Savage Species (2003).\\n_START_SECTION_\\nDescription\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nAn athach resembles something akin to an ogre, a troll, a fomorian or other such highly ugly giant, only with three arms. Two arms are located in the places where normal humanoids have their arms, while the third one sprouts from the chest. Athachs have sickly green coloration, and are covered in a layer of short, soft, brown fur. They have pear-shaped, flabby bodies, orc-like faces, black teeth, many warts and veins in their skin, and curly (if matted) hair and beards. Apparently, they are also poisonous.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nHabits and characteristics\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nAthachs can be either solitary, or in gangs of up to 2 or 4 individuals or tribes of 7 to 12. They are depicted as wearing the hides of dead farm animals, and sometimes tribal decorations of bones, jewelry and webs of rope. Not overly intelligent, they prefer to attack by charging, with a morning star in each of their three hands, into enemies and flailing at them indiscriminately (after a few rounds, however, they will typically attack whoever is causing them the most damage). If they cannot reach the enemy, they will throw rocks. They are immensely strong, and can easily bash any foe into a gory paste. When it comes to habits, athachs are not a great deal different from the brutality and dumbness of other giants, and are likely only regarded as aberrations due to the distinctly unusual features of 3 arms and poison. Athach language is a crude form of Giant._NEWLINE_Athachs are usually chaotic evil in alignment._NEWLINE_In Scottish folklore \"athach\" is a general term for various monsters (including giants) that are regarded as dangerous or hostile to human beings. These include among others the luideag (a female demon), the bocan or bauchan (a mischievous hobgoblin), and the fachan or direach, a grotesque one-eyed giant with one arm and one leg.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nOther publishers\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nThe athach appeared in Paizo Publishing\\'s book Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Bestiary 2 (2010), on page 33.'</td>\n",

In 1704, he moved to St. John\\'s, Newfoundland to act as an agent for New England merchants operating in the area. He eventually became a trader himself and he became a wealthy and significant property owner in St John\\'s, Harbour Grace, and Greenspond._NEWLINE_From 1699 to 1729, Newfoundland courts consisted solely of \"fishing Admirals\" who travelled to the island from England during the summers with the fishing fleets. Persons who committed capital offences were required to travel to England for trial, and no judicial officers were present in Newfoundland during the winters. By 1720, this situation had led to a high crime rate in St. John\\'s and the British government appointed Keen as the first \"winter\" justice of the peace who would conduct judicial business while the fishing Admirals were away._NEWLINE_In practice, Governor Henry Osborn allowed Keen and the other justices of the peace who were appointed to hear cases year round. There were many disputes between the justices of the peace and the fishing Admirals, and Keen became the leader of a movement to officially establish a permanent judiciary in Newfoundland. He was a close advisor to many of the governors of Newfoundland, most of whose tenure lasted only a few years. In 1750, the British government decided that justices of the peace in St John\\'s could sit in judgment as \"commissioners\" over all cases except treason, although they could only do so if the governor was present in Newfoundland. Keen was the first such commissioner to be appointed._NEWLINE_On 9 September 1754, Keen was attacked in his bed at his summer home when he awoke during a burglary. He was beaten with a scythe and the butt of a musket and died of his injuries in St. John nearly three weeks later. Eight men and one woman, Eleanor Power, were convicted of his murder before the court that Keen had presided over; four, including Power, were executed for the crime._NEWLINE_Keen\\'s son, William, inherited his property and his position as commissioner. William Keen, Jr. moved to England in 1760, but the Keen family retained property in St. John\\'s and Harbour Grace until 1839.'</td>\n",

At the time of the Domesday survey, the Shropshire and Herefordshire boundary divided the village. The Norman magnate Roger de Montgomery held the village from the King. He built many castles including Montgomery, Shrewsbury, Ludlow, Clun, Hopton and Oswestry; at the time over 90 per cent of the lordships and manors of Shropshire were held in Chief by him. His under-tenants in this area were Ralph de Mortimer, who held Bucknell (amongst his 123 manors with his chief domain in England being at Wigmore Castle), and William de Picot (also known as Picot de Say), with his chief domain at Clun Castle._NEWLINE_The earth mound at The Olde Farm in Bucknell is the remains of a Norman motte castle situated on the banks of the River Redlake, close to a river crossing point and to the Parish Church. In 1554\\xe2\\x80\\x9355 an Act of Parliament was passed transferring the whole of Bucknell to the county of Shropshire. The Lords of the Manor at that time were the Sitwell family._NEWLINE_Historically, most of the male population worked in agriculture and timber.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nBuildings\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nThe earliest of the existing buildings date back to the 17th century. The houses were built in a haphazard fashion near the river with easy access to water. The village depended on water from the river and wells until the 1920s when water was piped into the village from a spring above Chapel Lawn. The houses at the lower end of the village were very susceptible to flooding, and this hazard continued until the ford was walled up in the 1950s._NEWLINE_Bucknell had four pubs: The Sitwell Arms, The Plough (just opposite), The Railway Tavern and The Bridge End. The latter three are all now private houses, though a new pub, the Baron of Beef, is now open. Bucknell also had a shop and bakery in the Square and its own corn mill which was at the west end of the village. Bucknell Post office opened in the mid-19th century. The original post office was just round the corner and still goes by the name of The Old Post Office. The butcher's shop is still on its original site._NEWLINE_After World War I a Memorial Hall was built in the village, originally from a mess hut removed from a Canadian Army camp, and still stands. It contains plaques in memory of men from the parish who died serving in the World Wars. One of those behind its construction was William Burgoyne.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nServices\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nToday the village boasts an impressive number of businesses and public services for its size: two public houses, a post office, a butcher, a petrol forecourt and shop, a general store open every day, a railway station, a primary school and numerous companies providing services to local agricultural and forestry enterprises.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nThe school\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nThe Old School House was built in the 16th century, this part being the part of the building next to the river to provide education for those who could pay for it. The school remained until the present one was built in 1865. The Old School House then became a shop and bakers before becoming a private dwelling. The front part of the building pre-dates the rear by around 200 years making it 13th/14th century and whilst being restored was found to have once existed as a ground floor-only property and evidence of an open fire pit and an opening in the roof to allow the smoke to escape; this pre-dates the inglenook fireplace to the rear and was believed to have been a medieval great hall. Restoration was completed in 1999._NEWLINE_The land upon which the present school was built was given in 1865. The first schoolmaster appointed in 1867 to the new St Mary's National School was Mr Henry Evans, 24 years old. The school was extensively re-modelled in 1966 when additional teaching space and a kitchen was added enabling meals to be cooked on the premises. St Mary's school is a maintained Church of England primary school with 43 pupils on roll at January 2004. The age range is 4\\xe2\\x80\\x9311 years._NEWLINE_An independent school, Bedstone College, is also nearby.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nPopulation\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nDespite more houses, the number of people living in Bucknell has dropped. The population of the village in 1811 Census was 226. At the end of the 19th century this had risen to 546. In the 1981 Census the population of the village was 494; in 1991 the population of the parish (probably including Bedstone) was 601 consisting of some 250 dwellings and in 2001 it was 642 in 294 dwellings.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nTransport\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nThe village has a railway station on the Heart of Wales Line.

Steen\\'s father even leased him a brewery of his own in Delft from the years 1654 until 1657. He was the eldest of eight or more children. Like his even more famous contemporary Rembrandt van Rijn, Jan Steen attended the Latin school and became a student in Leiden. He received his painterly education from Nicolaes Knupfer (1603\\xe2\\x80\\x931660), a German painter of historical and figurative scenes in Utrecht. Influences of Knupfer can be found in Steen\\'s use of composition and colour. Other sources of inspiration were Adriaen van Ostade and Isaac van Ostade, painters of rural scenes, who lived in Haarlem. Whether Steen actually studied with Ostade is not known._NEWLINE_In 1648 Jan Steen and Gabri\\xc3\\xabl Metsu founded the painters\\' Guild of Saint Luke at Leiden. Soon after he became an assistant to the renowned landscape painter Jan van Goyen (1596\\xe2\\x80\\x931656), and moved into his house on the Bierkade in The Hague. On Oct 3, 1649 he married van Goyen\\'s daughter Margriet, with whom he would have eight children. Steen worked with his father-in-law until 1654, when he moved to Delft, where he ran the brewery De Slang (\"The Snake\") for three years without much success. After the explosion in Delft in 1654 the art market was depressed, but Steen painted A Burgomaster of Delft and his daughter. It does not seem to be clear if this painting should be called a portrait or a genre work._NEWLINE_Steen lived in Warmond, just north of Leiden, from 1656 till 1660 and in Haarlem from 1660 till 1670 and in both periods he was especially productive. In 1670, after the death of his wife in 1669 and his father in 1670, Steen moved back to Leiden, where he stayed the rest of his life. When the art market collapsed in 1672, called the Year of Disaster, Steen opened a tavern. In April 1673 he married Maria van Egmont, who gave him another child. In 1674 he became president of the Saint Lucas Guild. Frans van Mieris (1635- 1681) became one of his drinking companions. He died in Leiden in 1679 and was interred in a family grave in the Pieterskerk.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nWorks\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nDaily life was Jan Steen\\'s main pictorial theme. Many of the genre scenes he portrayed, as in The Feast of Saint Nicholas, are lively to the point of chaos and lustfulness, even so much that \"a Jan Steen household\", meaning a messy scene, became a Dutch proverb (een huishouden van Jan Steen). Subtle hints in his paintings seem to suggest that Steen meant to warn the viewer rather than invite him to copy this behaviour. Many of Steen\\'s paintings bear references to old Dutch proverbs or literature. He often used members of his family as models, and painted quite a few self-portraits in which he showed no tendency of vanity._NEWLINE_Steen did not shy from other themes: he painted historical, mythological and religious scenes, portraits, still lifes and natural scenes. His portraits of children are famous. He is also well known for his mastery of light and attention to detail, most notably in Persian rugs and other textiles._NEWLINE_Steen was prolific, producing about 800 paintings, of which roughly 350 survive. His work was valued much by contemporaries and as a result he was reasonably well paid for his work. He did not have many students\\xe2\\x80\\x94only Richard Brakenburgh is recorded\\xe2\\x80\\x94but his work proved a source of inspiration for many painters.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nConnection with the Rederijkers\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nIn 1945, Sturla Gudlaugsson, a specialist in Dutch seventeenth-century painting and iconography and Director of the Netherlands Institute for Art History and the Mauritshuis in The Hague, wrote The Comedians in the work of Jan Steen and his Contemporaries, which revealed that a major influence on Jan Steen\\'s work was the guild of the Rhetoricians or Rederijkers and their theatrical endeavors._NEWLINE_It is often suggested that Jan Steen\\'s paintings are a realistic portrayal of Dutch 17th-century life. However, not everything he did was a purely realistic representation of his day-to-day environment. Many of his scenes contain idyllic and bucolic fantasies and a declamatory emphasis redolent of theater._NEWLINE_Jan Steen\\'s connection to theater is easily verifiable through his connection to the Rederijkers. There are two kinds of evidence for this connection. First, Jan Steen Steen\\'s uncle belonged to the Rhetoricians in Leiden, where Steen was born and lived a substantial part of his life. Second, Jan Steen portrayed many scenes from the lives of the Rederijkers, an example being the painting Rhetoricians at a Window of 1662\\xe2\\x80\\x9366. The piece is currently held in the Philadelphia Museum of Art which was established in February 1876. The humanity, humour and optimism of the figures suggest that Jan Steen knew these men well, and wanted to portray them positively.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nTheater\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nWith his lavish and moralising style, it is logical that Steen would employ the stratagems from theater for his purposes. There is conclusive evidence that the characters in Steen\\'s paintings are predominantly theatrical characters and not ones from reality._NEWLINE_Steen\\'s numerous paintings of a theme most commonly entitled The Doctor\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Visit, such as the composition of 1665\\xe2\\x80\\x9370 in the Rijksmuseum, illustrate his theatrical approach. The story is simple: a doctor attending a young maiden discovers that she is not ill but is in fact pregnant with child. The doctor is a comical character who wears a biretta, a doublet and a small pleated ruff. In fact, he is dressed in the fashion of 1570, not 1670. In contrast, the girl wears what would be the height of fashion at the time of the painting, a Japanese-styled loose kimono robe. _NEWLINE_This anachronism can be explained only one way: this is not a real doctor but an actor wearing a traditional theater costume. According to Gudlaugsson, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cnever would so unusual and so completely uncontemporary a costume occur as that of the doctors in [Steen\\'s] work\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.'</td>\n",

A sword bayonet design, the M1917 bayonet design was based on the British Pattern 1913 bayonet, itself derived from the Pattern 1907 bayonet, which incorporated a long 17-inch blade. While designed primarily for the M1917 rifle, the bayonet was fitted for use on all the \"trench\" shotguns at the time.  Note the that the M1917 bayonet and the British Pattern 14 bayonet from which it was derived were not interchangeable, and the two transverse cuts on the M1917 grips were meant to provide easy recognition in the dark._NEWLINE_The M1917 was used frequently during the several different Banana Wars._NEWLINE_The U.S. continued to use the World War I-made M1917 bayonets during World War II because of large stockpiles left over. The new Trench Guns being procured and issued were still designed to use the old M1917 bayonet._NEWLINE_The bayonet was again called on during the Korean War for issue with the various Trench guns still in service._NEWLINE_In a strange twist of fate, in 1966 procurement orders were let for brand new production M1917 bayonets. The contracts were issued to General Cutlery of Fremont, Ohio and Canadian Arsenals Ltd., the old Long Branch Arsenal of Quebec, Canada. Stockpiles had finally run out, and new Winchester 1200 trench shotguns were being issued. These were used in limited quantities during the Vietnam War._NEWLINE_It was not until towards the end of the Vietnam war that new Military shotguns were designed to use the newer knife bayonets. Such as the Stevens Model 77E with the M5 Bayonet, or the United States Marine Corps \"Model 870 Mark 1\" shotgun with the M7 bayonet'</td>\n",

The curator assisted the chamberlain or \"master of the wardrobe\", who supervised all aspects of the emperor\\'s wardrobe \\xe2\\x80\\x93 updating the inventories, placing orders, paying bills, and establishing regulations. This position was initially held, between 1804 and 1811 by count Augustin de R\\xc3\\xa9musat. When it appeared in 1811 R\\xc3\\xa9musat was mismanaging the wardrobe, an inventory was requested to Jean-Pierre Charvet, and R\\xc3\\xa9musat was replaced by count Henri de Turenne d\\'Aynac. Christofle\\'s uncle, \\xc3\\x89tienne Charvet, was the steward of the ch\\xc3\\xa2teau de Malmaison and later of the ch\\xc3\\xa2teau de Saint Cloud. \\xc3\\x89tienne Charvet\\'s daughter Louise Caroline Catherine (1791\\xe2\\x80\\x931861), Christofle\\'s first cousin, married at the age of 14 Constant, Napoleon\\'s head valet. The marriage was arranged by Napoleon himself, who signed the marriage contract. She became in 1813 a linen keeper at the ch\\xc3\\xa2teau de Saint Cloud, therefore responsible for making the imperial shirts. Her portrait (Figure, right) was bequested to the Malmaison museum in 1929 by \\xc3\\x89douard Charvet. Constant and his wife Louise did not to follow Napoleon in his exile to Elba, an \"enormous mistake\" according to Christofle\\'s father.  Instead, they moved to Elbeuf and invested in a weaving factory, created by Louise\\'s brother Jean-Pierre and specialized in novelty fabrics for pants and lady coats._NEWLINE_Christofle Charvet created the first shirtmaker store in Paris, for which the new term chemisier (shirtmaker) was coined. Previously, shirts were generally made by linen keepers with fabric provided by the customer, but in this store of a new kind, clients were measured, fabric selected and shirts made on site. The development of this specialty trade was favored by a change in men\\'s fashion, with more importance given to the waistcoat and the shirt collar, which called for more propositions for the shirt front and a technical change. Previously, shirts were cut by linen keepers entirely of rectangles and squares. There were no shaping seams and no need for shirt patterns. The new interest for a closer fitting shirt led to curving the armhole and neckline or adding a shoulder yoke, by application to the shirt of tailoring techniques. The new kind of shirt was called chemise \\xc3\\xa0 pi\\xc3\\xa8ce (yoked shirt). Alan Flusser credits Christofle Charvet with the original design of a collar that could be turned down or folded, much in the manner of contemporary collars, and the concept of the detachable collar._NEWLINE_In 1839, Charvet already had some imitators, but still the \"best supply\". The same year, Charvet held the title of official shirtmaker to the Jockey Club, a very exclusive Parisian circle,  then headed by prince Napol\\xc3\\xa9on Joseph Ney and inspired by count Alfred d\\'Orsay, a famous French dandy. It had about 250 members, mostly aristocrats, who, despite the name of their club, were more interested in elegance than horses. Being a member was a necessary step in order to become a lion, the term used then for a dandy. In an advertisement of March 1839, Charvet, presenting himself as the Club\\'s shirtmaker, claimed to offer \"elegance,  perfection, moderate prices\". Soon after, the claim to moderate prices was dropped (see images, right)._NEWLINE_Joseph-\\xc3\\x89douard Charvet, known as \\xc3\\x89douard Charvet, (1842\\xe2\\x80\\x931928) succeeded his father Christofle in 1868. He in turn was joined in the early 20th century by his three sons, \\xc3\\x89tienne, Raymond and Paul.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nLocation\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nThe store was initially located on the rue de Richelieu, at n\\xc2\\xb0 103 and later at n\\xc2\\xb0 93._NEWLINE_It moved to n\\xc2\\xb0 25, place Vend\\xc3\\xb4me in 1877. This move reflected a shift in the center of the Parisian high society and the growing importance for fashion of both rue de la Paix, where the house of Worth had opened in 1858, and the palais Garnier against the Th\\xc3\\xa9\\xc3\\xa2tre Italien, closer to Charvet\\'s original location. Though Charvet began to offer women\\'s blouses and men\\'s suits in its new store, men\\'s shirts remained the house\\'s specialty. An American journalist, visiting the store in 1909, reported \"there were shirts of every variety and almost every color [,] artistic enough to make one long for them all, and each and every one most beautifully made.\" The store was noted for its displays, compared in 1906 to Loie Fuller performances, and Charvet paid an \"immense salary\" to the window decorator, who displayed \"each day a new series\", producing \"veritable works of art in his harmonious combinations of scarves and handkerchiefs and hosiery\"._NEWLINE_In 1921, the store moved to n\\xc2\\xb0 8, place Vend\\xc3\\xb4me._NEWLINE_In 1982, it moved to its current location, at n\\xc2\\xb0 28._NEWLINE_Charvet remains the oldest shop on place Vend\\xc3\\xb4me, which explains both the inclusion of the location into the firm\\'s name, and the use as a logo of the sun device, designed by Jules Hardouin-Mansart to ornate the handrails of the balconies of the Place, which was built in honor of Louis XIV, the Sun King.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nInternational recognition\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nIn 1855 Charvet exhibited shirts and drawers at the Paris World\\'s fair. The jury noted that Parisian shirt makers had an \"unquestionable supremacy\". Again, at the next Paris World\\'s fair, Charvet exhibited shirts, drawers, vests and handkerchieves and the Jury noted luxury shirts were a Parisian \"monopoly\". When the  king-to-be Edward VII visited the fair, he ordered Parisian shirts, as many other foreign visitors did,  and remained a loyal customer of Charvet, \"honoring him during forty years with a special kindness\" (See List of Charvet customers). Charvet created for the prince of Wales a certain style of shirt collar, the stand-up turn-down collar, also referred to as the H.R.H. collar, which became very popular at the end of the 19th century (Figure, right)._NEWLINE_In 1863, Charvet was considered the first producer of fine shirts in Paris, claiming superiority \"for taste and for elegance\" on cuffs, bib and fit. Charvet\\'s store was a \"very important\" destination for English visitors in Paris. In the following years, Charvet developed its specialization in royal trousseaux. In 1878, he won a silver medal at the World Fair and a gold medal at the 1889 Paris World\\'s fair, for which the Eiffel tower was built. When it won the latter, the jury noted: \"Fine shirts remain the property and glory of Paris. To be convinced of it, it is sufficient to give a look to the displays of the companies specialized in royal haberdashery\". Other royal patrons confirmed this princely speciality of Charvet, such as Alfonso XII of Spain (1878), Antoine, duke of Montpensier (1879), Philippe, comte de Paris (1893), and sultan Abdul Hamid II (See List of Charvet customers)._NEWLINE_The clientele of Charvet also included artists such as Charles Baudelaire, who gave a metaphysical dimension to dandyism, George Sand, whose lover Alfred de Musset never succeeded to become a member of the Jockey Club, \\xc3\\x89douard Manet, nicknamed the \"dandy of painting\" or Jacques Offenbach, composer of La Vie Parisienne. In 1893, when he tried to enter the Acad\\xc3\\xa9mie fran\\xc3\\xa7aise, Verlaine had himself photographed wearing a \"very beautiful Charvet scarf\" (Figure, left). Allegedly, a gift of 100,000 francs to \"the greatest poet of our time, Verlaine\", was the stake of a bet between Edmond de Polignac and Robert de Montesquiou. Having lost the bet, Montesquiou \"naturally kept the 100,000 francs but gave Verlaine a very beautiful scarf\". Upon hearing the story, Polignac cut all relations with Montesquiou. Nevertheless, some other writers consider this story as a legend circulated by Montesquiou himself, as no document establishes the existence of this bet and Montesquiou was almost the only one in the elegant and cultured world to care for Verlaine._NEWLINE_In 1894, an administrative report praised Charvet for constantly seeking high-novelty and setting the trend for other Parisian shirtmakers, having irreproachable manufacturing standards, and successfully enticing French factories to produce the raw materials traditionally supplied by England._NEWLINE_After his 1897 portrait by Giovanni Boldini, Montesquiou\\'s dandyism became famous and made him a frequent subject of caricatures. In 1903, a French satirical magazine illustrated by a caricature from Sem to which Marcel Proust alluded in a letter to Montesquiou, had Montesquiou saying: \"Nobody in the world ever saw such things! Pinks, blues, lilacs, in silk, and in cobweb! Charvet is the greatest artist in the Creation.\" In a letter to Montesquiou, alludes to the caricature by Sem of Montesquiou examining products at Charvet (Figure, right)._NEWLINE_In 1905, Charvet, then also established in London, at 45 New Bond St, and \"rumored\" to be contemplating an establishment in New York,  was considered the \"foremost haberdashery of Paris and London\". Its customers included not only royalty, such as Alfonso XIII of Spain (warrant granted in 1913); Edward VIII, duke of Windsor; the French president Paul Deschanel, noted for his elegant Charvet cravats; but also members of the high society gravitating around dandies such as Robert de Montesquiou and Evander Berry Wall, or artists as Jean Cocteau, who called Charvet \"magic\" and wrote that it is \"where the rainbow finds ideas\", and his friend Sergei Diaghilev. According to Proust, whose shirts, ties and waistcoats were from Charvet, maybe by imitation of Montesquiou, the latter was \"the sign of a certain world, of a certain elegance\". Proust also spent long moments at Charvet in search of a perfect tone for his cravats, such as a \"creamy pink\". His tank tops (marcel in French) also came from Charvet. In his Remembrance of Things Past (1919), Marcel, the narrator, waiting for the appointed hour of his lunch engagement at Swann\\'s house, whiles away his time \"tightening from time to time the knot of [his] magnificent Charvet tie\". In 1908, Charvet won a Grand Prix at the London Exhibition._NEWLINE_ In 1901, Charvet opened a laundry at 3, rue des Capucines, next to his store, considered by some to be the first established in Paris, a fact which later led some others to assume Charvet\\'s laundry business had predated shirtmaking. It was advertised as applying Pasteur\\'s and Grancher\\'s principles. In 1903, Charvet moved his \"model laundry\", to the place du March\\xc3\\xa9 Saint Honor\\xc3\\xa9, on premises belonging to the city of Paris, which specially authorized him in view of an innovative ozone-based process, then licensed to the Parisian hospitals. The soiled clothes, picked up at the customer\\'s house by \"special cars\", were disinfected and bleached with ozone, then placed in a revolving drum worked by electricity and soaked in a diastatic solution, in order to remove the starch and make the linen whiter, subsequently washed in soap and water, afterwards in a solution of ammonia to remove the soap, then whitened, starched, calendered and hand ironed. The process was considered a model both for the quality of the output and for the care taken of the health of the workers. A \"surprising\" amount of laundry was sent over by British customers. Like many other foreign customers, William Stewart Halsted and William H. Welch regularly sent their shirts to be laundered to Charvet in Paris. Promotional stamps were produced for this laundry business and became collectible. In 1906, a branch of the laundry was opened at 1, rue du Colis\\xc3\\xa9e, near the Champs-\\xc3\\x89lys\\xc3\\xa9es. During World War I, Charvet significantly reduced the price of its laundry services to keep sufficient work for all his employees. Towards the end of the war, the shortage of coal severely hit Charvet\\'s laundry activity. The \"model laundry\" of place du march\\xc3\\xa9 Saint Honor\\xc3\\xa9 was discontinued in 1933 when the place was restructured._NEWLINE_Charvet shirts were imported into the United States as early as 1853 (See figure right). By 1860, Charvet\\'s shirts turnover was equally divided between luxury bespoke shirts sold in the Paris store and ready made shirts for export, particularly to Russia, Great-Britain and Havana. Also, following the custom of the time, designs and models were sold to American stores, to be locally reproduced. In the 1920s, Charvet\\'s name was associated in the United States with linen fabrics in \"startingly floreated\" patterns, used for shirt bibs and cuffs. Nevertheless, into the middle of the 20th century, Charvet was selling only bespoke shirts in the Paris store._NEWLINE_In 1908, Charvet was the first European company to import American suits hand tailored in Chicago._NEWLINE_The name Charvet was so well known that it became associated with a certain silk fabric for ties (See Charvet (fabric)). Charvet\\'s notability also extended to other items of clothing, such as shirts, shirtings, ties, gloves, dress suits, waistcoats (see image, left), undergarments, pocketchieves, and women\\'s waistbands or shirtwaists (See figures left), worn with special models of ties for ladies, such as one called le juge modeled after a judge\\'s lappets. The Chicago Tribune reported in 1909 that Charvet was showing \"scarf pins that match in color any scarf that may be bought and some have the same designs carried out in them done in enamel. There are also waistcoasts buttons to be worn with certain ties and there are sets of these, cufflinks, and pins, all of which exactly match\". Charvet also supplied silk bed-sheets in colours such as black, green, mauve or violet._NEWLINE_In the early 20th century, Charvet launched a toilet water, in a rectangular beveled bottle. One of the customers for this perfume was Boy Capel, Coco Chanel\\'s lover. In 1921, two years after his accidental death, the flacon of Chanel\\'s famous N\\xc2\\xba\\xc2\\xa05 perfume was produced in the image of the Charvet bottle._NEWLINE_Like many European companies, Charvet was greatly affected by World War I: \"our looms have been destroyed, our collections pillaged, our printing blocks burned\". Nevertheless, it continued to send representatives to the United States to show collections of novelties.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nArt Deco period\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nAfter 1912, with the development of the Art Deco style, Charvet, along with fashion designer Paul Poiret, started to commission art work from the French painter Raoul Dufy, the \"granddaddy of modem chic\", through the French weaver Bianchini-F\\xc3\\xa9rier. Some of the first were related to the war, such as Les Alli\\xc3\\xa9s or the Victory Rooster (Figure, left). This was followed by more silk squares, woven silk fabrics for vests, and printed ramie fabrics for dressing gowns and shirts. Some famous customers of the period were fashion designer Coco Chanel and the Maharadjah of Patiala who once placed a single order of 86 dozen shirts._NEWLINE_In the late 1920s, Charvet was considered to produce \"the finest cravats in the world\", with either conservative designs or \"decidedly original\" patterns, such as postage-stamps (See below) or much more \"modernist\" patterns. At an exhibition called \"L\\'art de la soie\" held at the Mus\\xc3\\xa9e Galliera in Paris in 1927, Charvet presented dressing gowns and neckties in matching patterns, together with pyjamas, shirts and handherchieves. The company developed a practice of sending merchandises to its customers for approval, allowing them to select some or none and return the rest, subsequently referred to as the Charvet method. It conceived a range of free-form bold printed tie patterns which gained wide popularity in the USA. \"Its chic was in their unfussy, nonchalant bearing. To the delight of their many admirers, the Charvets\\' open settings facilitated blending with all kind of fancy suits [...] The original Charvet prints became the first, and regrettably almost the last, bold figured necktie to symbolize upper-class taste\". Some such bold Charvet Art Deco ties which had belonged to John Ringling are on display at the John and Mable Ringling Museum of Art. These patterns, for which charvet became a generic name, \"foreshadowed\" the colorful designs which became popular after the war. The company also produced beach linen robes with patterns up to two feet in diameter._NEWLINE_In the 1930s, some window displays were made by painters as Andr\\xc3\\xa9 Derain or Maurice de Vlaminck.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nColban\\'s takeover\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nWhen in 1965 the Charvet heirs sought to sell the firm, they were contacted by an American buyer. The French government, knowing Charvet had been for a long time General de Gaulle\\'s shirtmaker, grew concerned. The French Ministry of Industry instructed Denis Colban, Charvet\\'s main supplier, to locate a French buyer. Rather than approaching investors he decided to purchase the company himself._NEWLINE_Until then, Charvet was operated in much the same way as it had been since its foundation: a customer was shown only what he requested, in most cases something fairly conservative. After Mr. Colban bought the firm, things changed. The change started when Baron Rothschild came into the store and asked to see some shirting fabrics, one of which was pink. When M. Colban, following previous Charvet practice, advised against the color, the Baron retorted, \"If not for me, who is it for?\" Some time later, Nelson Rockefeller requested some shirt swatches be sent to New York. Bold stripes and unusual colors were sent and eventually selected. Colban had changed Charvet\\'s policies as well as its role in the design process with the customer. A wide range of products was put on display, transforming the store in a \"veritable casbah\" of colors and \"almost edible\" fabrics. Colban also brought significant changes to the aspect of the store, having all the venerable furniture varnished in black. He created new lines of products and started ready-to-wear finely made shirts for men and women. A few years after, he was one of the first of many famous European shops and designers to sell ready-to-wear shirts, ties and accessories to Bergdorf Goodman. However, even while developing these new pre-made lines of products, Colban always insisted on the bespoke aspect of the firm as its core identity. He emphasised that \"the essential hardest of all to accomplish in today\\'s world of quick and easy pseudo solutions, is an atmosphere of \\'yes\\' to the customer and, even more, a respect for that commitment\", re-iterating the focus of Charvet on its bespoke business._NEWLINE_Colban refused numerous offers to sell the company, maintaining the single store in Paris and continuing the house as a family business. After his death in 1994, the company has been managed by his two children, Anne-Marie and Jean-Claude._NEWLINE_Modern customers include French presidents Fran\\xc3\\xa7ois Mitterrand and Jacques Chirac, American presidents John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan, French actors Catherine Deneuve and Philippe Noiret, American movie stars Sofia Coppola and Bruce Willis, fashion designers Yves Saint Laurent and Jasper Conran (See also: List of Charvet customers.).\\n_START_SECTION_\\nCharvet today\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nOf the five most prominent French shirtmakers of the 20th century\\xe2\\x80\\x94Bouvin, Charvet, Poirier, Seelio, and Seymous\\xe2\\x80\\x94all but Charvet have closed their doors. It is also the only remaining shirtmaker on Place Vend\\xc3\\xb4me._NEWLINE_The goal of the company is to give its customers the option to custom order or customize everything it sells, from neckwear (including bow ties) to underwear, with \"the idea that a garment that carries a personal stamp exceeds any other form of luxury\".  Bolts of fabric on display throughout the store can be held against oneself to see how they really look. Charvet creates exclusive fabrics for all its collections and prides itself of going a long way to satisfy customers, remaking on request ties purchased years earlier or changing a shirt\\'s frayed collar and cuffs.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nStore\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nThe store is located in one of the h\\xc3\\xb4tels particuliers of Place Vend\\xc3\\xb4me, Number 28. This building has a three-story Jules Hardouin Mansart facade, behind which Charvet occupies seven floors, each owner on the Place having built to his own needs. This is the only store directly operated by Charvet. It is open from 10:00\\xc2\\xa0am to 7:00\\xc2\\xa0pm, Monday through Saturday._NEWLINE_Per Denis Colban\\'s merchandising ideas, the ground floor offers a contrast between the formality of the setting and the seemingly informal abundance of silk accessories, from ties to scarves to the \"signature\" silk passementerie-knot cufflinks invented here. Each necktie comes in at least two dozen colorways and new designs arrive each week._NEWLINE_Ready-to-wear shirts and at-home clothing are displayed on the fourth floor, ready-to-wear blouses on the second floor, and children\\'s shirts on the first floor, but the third floor is dedicated to bespoke shirtmaking. This \"centre of the universe for shirt aficionados\" could be the largest selection of fine shirtings in the world, with over 6,000 different fabrics, including a \"legendary\" Mur des Blancs (Wall of Whites) of four hundred different white fabrics in 104 shades of white and another of two hundred solid blues. Customers can \"debate not just the shade of white, not just the choice of cuff, not just the angle, depth and proportion of the collar, but also the infinitesimal differences in the weight of the interlining in collar and cuff and how this can and should be varied between formal, semi-formal and casual shirts\". The richly colored and unique\" fabrics are presented in full bolts, not on swatch cards. Most of them are designed in-house by Charvet, for its own exclusive use  and woven from specially chosen gossypium barbadense cotton from the Nile delta. About a thousand new patterns are introduced each year, all of them registered. The Charvet stripes are often multicolored, asymmetric, thinner than English stripes, softer and subtler in the matching of shades._NEWLINE_Men\\'s custom tailoring is on the sixth floor, which has the atmosphere of a men\\'s club. Some 4,500 bolts of fabric are on display there, and the walls are hung with 1960s\\' fashion illustrations of Dean Martin look-alikes drawn by Jean Choiselat.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nShirts\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nThe \"unique\" care for precision and symmetry expresses French classicism and is, according to Marie-Claude Siccard, a paradigm of the care for quality in luxury products. In particular, a lot of attention is given to the regularity of stitches and the matching of patterns. On a typical striped ready-to-wear shirt and unlike most other makes, the placket is matched with the front, the face of the collar with the bottom, the collar stripes line up with the yoke stripes, the yoke stripes with the sleeve stripes, the sleeve stripes with the sleeve placket stripes, and finally the shade of yarn used for the buttonholes is matched to the stripe, the whole process creating the feeling the shirt is all one piece.  The yoke is one-piece and curved to follow the back. The left cuff is made one-quarter inch longer than the right to allow for the watch. The allowance is lower for made-to-order shirts. The cuff is made more or less wide, depending if the customer wants his watch to remain hidden under the cuff or to show. According to a Charvet representative, many customers have two different types of shirts: those for evening wear, intended to be worn with a flat watch, and the others for day wear, with a thicker watch. For men, shirt tails are square and vented for a clean look. For women, they are rounded, with a signature side-seam gusset. The collar is very clean-cut, made from six layers of unfused cloth for a dressy, yet not stiff, appearance.  Instead, a free floating stiffener aims to provide more comfort and a better shape. The stitching on a standard collar is four millimeters from the edge. The stitching of the top and the edges are precise and well-planned. The shirts are stitched with twin rows of single-needle tailoring, sewn one row at a time for minimum puckering and maximum fit. There are twenty stitches per inch. Buttons are made from Australian mother-of-pearl, cut from the surface of the oyster shell for added strength and greater color clarity. For formal shirts, bibs are hand pleated. Though its traditional ready-to-wear shirts are trim, the company has also introduced in 2009 a \"slim fit\" line._NEWLINE_The care involved in the process of making a bespoke shirt is, according to Lara Marlowe, an expression of French perfectionism. It requires a minimum of 28 measurements and an initial version made in basic cotton. The fit is \"full and snug at the same time\". The minimum order is one shirt. There are only fifty shirt-makers working in the Saint-Gaultier atelier and only one person works on a shirt at a time, whether custom or ready-to-wear,doing everything except for the buttonholes and pressing the shirt. Each shirt takes thirty days to complete.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nPyjamas\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nThe jacket is made of 14 pieces and the pants of 5. As for the shirts, patterns are matched throughout; depending on the pattern complexity, the production time is between 7 and 9 hours. Charvet pyjamas are, according to Fran\\xc3\\xa7ois Simon, a cult object.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nNeckwear\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nCharvet ties, ranked as the best designer\\'s ties in the US, are handmade, generally from a thick multicolor brocade silk, of a high yarn count, often enhanced by the addition of a hidden color, producing a dense fabric which goes through a proprietary finishing to acquire lustre, fluidity and resilience and achieve the right knot. The company develops its own exclusive patterns and colors. It creates about 8,000 models per year, Jacquard woven on exclusive commission, with silk either alone or mixed with other precious yarns, such as cashmere,  camel hair, bamboo yarn or covered with laminated precious metals, such as silver, gold or platinum, with techniques dating back to the 14th century when the popes were based in Avignon, which were also used in the 1920s for vests. Further to a long history of brocade patterns, first used in the 19th century for vests and then for ties, Charvet offers, according to Bernhard Roetzel, the largest range of woven silk neckties in the world. The ties collection, sometime \"unmistakably bold\" or \"witty [and] wicked\", often noted for its shimmer and changing colors (Charvet ties\\' shimmer \"has become so synonymous with the company that we call it the Charvet effect\", says a retailer.), uses about 5,000 shades in over 100,000 combinations._NEWLINE_Ties are made from three pieces of silk material cut at a 45-degree angle. They are sewn entirely by hand before being hand folded into shape. Sevenfold ties are available on order. Until the 1960s, nearly all Charvet ties were sevenfold. The company then decided an interlining could bring an improvement, helping protect the shape despite the pulling, and designed a proprietary interlining \"which helps the silk keep its resilience and spring, but is not an obstruction when you tie a knot\"._NEWLINE_The company produced a range of political ties for the 2008 American presidential campaign._NEWLINE_During the 1950s, it invented a special style of bow tie, a cross between a batwing and a butterfly, for the Duke of Windsor, now referred to as the \"Charvet cut\"._NEWLINE_The eponymous style n\\xc2\\xb0 30 of the book on the 188 styles of tie knots is a three layered bow-tie worn by a woman, the constitutive ribbons being stitched together behind the neck.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nSuits\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nFollowing the traditional bespoke process, measurements are taken, a basted canvas is built around the customer, then disassembled and traced onto paper, after which there are two more fittings. The suit is hand-sewn.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nClients\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nFor various reasons, some customers, such as Charles Haughey or Bernard-Henri L\\xc3\\xa9vy, \"became synonymous with Charvet\".'</td>\n",

Relatively well-educated, he became a bookkeeper for a coal company in Wales._NEWLINE_In 1906, he emigrated, ending up in Cleveland, Ohio, where he landed another bookkeeping job, for a real estate agency, a job he held for 10 years. During this time, he attended Cleveland Law School at night, earning his law degree in 1916._NEWLINE_Blythin then turned to the practice of law. In 1935, Blythin accepted appointment as an assistant to the Cleveland city law director. He became law director in 1940. In January 1941, when Harold H. Burton resigned as Cleveland mayor in order to take a seat in the United States Senate, Blythin, as law director, automatically succeeded Burton to the mayor\\'s office. In November, however, Blythin failed to win election to the seat, losing to Democrat Frank Lausche._NEWLINE_In 1943, Blythin left private law practice to accept an executive position at Western Reserve University._NEWLINE_In 1949, Blythin was elected to a judgeship in the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas, where he served until his death. During his tenure on the court, Blythin presided over the notorious 1954 murder trial of Sam Sheppard.  His stewardship of the trial was later overturned by the United States Supreme Court which termed the trial \"a Roman Holiday.\"  In fact, famous columnist Dorothy Kilgallen reputedly wrote that in a private conference just prior to the trial beginning, Blythin told her, in his opinion, Sheppard was guilty. According to friends and family members, this private conference never occurred but was Ms Killgallen\\'s retaliation for the judge admonishing her for showing up late and disrupting the court proceedings. However, the appellate record contains affidavits signed by others who claimed to have heard Judge Blythin make statements similar to the statement Killgallen claimed to have heard.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nPersonal life and death\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nBlythin married Jane Rankin on April 3, 1913, and they had five children, Robert, Arthur, Glen, Jane, and William._NEWLINE_Judge Blythin suffered a severe heart attack at his home in Parma Heights, Ohio, on February 12, 1958.

Among Siberia Turkic mythology, Kormos is a devilish entity, living in the underworld. Since the souls after death can turn into Kormos, they are often associated with ancestral spirits. Yakuts apply Yor for the unsatisfied dead, who roam the earth. Other names are used for them are Alban, Cah\\xc4\\xb1k, Ozor, and more. _NEWLINE_The good souls protect their families and are under \\xc3\\x9clgens command. The evil souls, who commonly dwell in the underworld, are controlled by Erlik. A third type of ghosts are those who are neither good nor evil, but simply suffering in a pathetic state. _NEWLINE_Demonic Kormos, also called \"Sokor K\\xc3\\xb6rm\\xc3\\xb6s\" (blind angel), are the servants sent by Erlik to harm people and attempt to pull them into the underworld.

The exact date of his birth is uncertain; Robert Chamber\\'s \"Book of Days\" (1868) gives an alternative birth date of 14 July, and Hunter is recorded as always celebrating his birthday on this date rather than 13 July as shown in the parish register of the town of his birth.  Family papers cite his birthday as being variously on 7 and 9 February. Three of Hunter\\'s siblings (one of whom had also been named John) died of illness before he was born. An elder brother was William Hunter, the anatomist. As a youth, John showed little talent, and helped his brother-in-law as a cabinet-maker.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nEducation and training\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nWhen nearly 21 he visited William in London, where his brother had become an admired teacher of anatomy. John started as his assistant in dissections (1748), and was soon running the practical classes on his own.  It has recently been alleged that Hunter\\'s brother William, and his brother\\'s former tutor William Smellie, were responsible for the deaths of many women whose corpses were used for their studies on pregnancy. John is alleged to have been connected to these deaths, since at the time he was acting as William\\'s assistant.  However, persons who have studied life in Georgian London agree that the number of gravid women who died in London during the years of Hunter\\'s and Smellie\\'s work was not particularly high for that locality and time; the prevalence of pre-eclampsia \\xe2\\x80\\x94 a common condition affecting 10% of all pregnancies, and one which is easily treated today, but for which no treatment was known in Hunter\\'s time \\xe2\\x80\\x94 would more than suffice to explain a mortality rate that seems suspiciously high to 21st-century readers. In The Anatomy of the Gravid Uterus Exhibited in Figures, published in 1774, Hunter provides case histories for at least four of the subjects illustrated._NEWLINE_Hunter heavily researched blood while bloodletting patients with various diseases. This helped him develop his theory that inflammation was a bodily response to disease, and was not itself pathological._NEWLINE_Hunter studied under William Cheselden at Chelsea Hospital and Percival Pott at St. Bartholomew\\'s Hospital.  Hunter also studied with Marie Marguerite Bih\\xc3\\xa9ron, a famous anatomist and wax modeler teaching in London; some of the illustrations in his text were likely hers.   After qualifying, he became assistant surgeon (house surgeon) at St George\\'s Hospital (1756) and surgeon (1768).\\n_START_SECTION_\\nArmy surgeon\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nHunter was commissioned as an Army surgeon in 1760 and was staff surgeon on expedition to the French island of Belle \\xc3\\x8ele in 1761, then served in 1762 with the British Army. Contrary to prevailing medical opinion at the time, Hunter was against the practice of \\'dilation\\' of gunshot wounds.  This practice involved the surgeon deliberately expanding a wound with the aim of making the gunpowder easier to remove.  Although sound in theory, in the unsanitary conditions of the time it increased the chance of infection, and Hunter\\'s practice was not to perform dilation \\'except when preparatory to something else\\' such as the removal of bone fragments.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nPost-Army career\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nHunter left the Army in 1763, and spent at least five years working in partnership with James Spence, a well-known London dentist.  Although not the first person to conduct tooth transplants between living people, he did advance the state of knowledge in this area by realising that the chances of a successful tooth transplant would be improved if the donor tooth was as fresh as possible and was matched for size with the recipient.  These principles are still used in the transplanation of internal organs.  Although donated teeth never properly bonded with the recipients\\' gums, one of Hunter\\'s patients stated that he had three which lasted for six years, a remarkable period at the time._NEWLINE_Hunter set up his own anatomy school in London in 1764 and started in private surgical practice.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nEarl\\'s Court house\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nIn 1765, Hunter bought a house near the Earl\\'s Court district in London.  The house had large grounds which were used to house a collection of animals including \\'zebra, Asiatic buffaloes and mountain goats\\', as well as jackals. In the house itself, Hunter boiled down the skeletons of some of these animals as part of research on animal anatomy. A newspaper article reported that many animals there were \\'supposed to be hostile to each other but . . . in this new paradise, the greatest friendship prevails\\', and this image may have been the inspiration for the Doctor Dolittle literary character.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nSelf-experimentation\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nHunter was elected as Fellow of the Royal Society in 1767.  At this time he was considered the leading authority on venereal diseases, and believed that gonorrhea and syphilis were caused by a single pathogen. Living in an age when physicians frequently experimented on themselves, he was the subject of an often-repeated legend claiming that he had inoculated himself with gonorrhea, using a needle that was unknowingly contaminated with syphilis. When he contracted both syphilis and gonorrhea, he claimed it proved his erroneous theory that they were the same underlying venereal disease.  The experiment, reported in Hunter\\'s A Treatise on the Venereal Diseases (part 6 section 2, 1786), does not indicate self-experimentation; this experiment was most likely performed on a third party. Hunter championed treatment of gonorrhea and syphilis with mercury and cauterization. Because of Hunter\\'s reputation, knowledge concerning the true nature of gonorrhea and syphilis was set back, and his theory was not proved to be wrong until 51 years later through research by French physician Philippe Ricord.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nLate career\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nIn 1768, Hunter was appointed as surgeon to St George\\'s Hospital. Later, he became a member of the Company of Surgeons.  In 1776, he was appointed surgeon to King George III._NEWLINE_In 1783, Hunter moved to a large house in Leicester Square. The space allowed him to arrange his collection of nearly 14,000 preparations of over 500 species of plants and animals into a teaching museum. The same year, he acquired the skeleton of the 2.31 m (7\\' 7\") Irish giant Charles Byrne against Byrne\\'s clear deathbed wishes\\xe2\\x80\\x94he had asked to be buried at sea. Hunter bribed a member of the funeral party (possibly for \\xc2\\xa3500) and filled the coffin with rocks at an overnight stop, then subsequently published a scientific description of the anatomy and skeleton. \"He is now, after having being stolen on the way to his funeral,\" says Muinzer, \"on display permanently as a sort of freak exhibit in the memorial museum to the person who screwed him over, effectively.\" The skeleton, today, with much of Hunter\\'s surviving collection, is in the Hunterian Museum at the Royal College of Surgeons in London._NEWLINE_In 1786, he was appointed deputy surgeon to the British Army and in March 1790, he was made surgeon general by the then Prime Minister, William Pitt.  While in this post, he instituted a reform of the system for appointment and promotion of army surgeons based on experience and merit, rather than the patronage-based system that had been in place._NEWLINE_Hunter\\'s death in 1793 was due to a heart attack brought on by an argument at St George\\'s Hospital concerning the admission of students. He was originally buried at St Martin-in-the-Fields, but in 1859 was reburied in the north aisle of the nave in Westminster Abbey, reflecting his importance to the country._NEWLINE_Hunter\\'s character has been discussed by biographers:_NEWLINE_His nature was kindly and generous, though outwardly rude and repelling.... Later in life, for some private or personal reason, he picked a quarrel with the brother who had formed him and made a man of him, basing the dissension upon a quibble about priority unworthy of so great an investigator. Yet three years later, he lived to mourn this brother\\'s death in tears._NEWLINE_He was described by one of his assistants late in his life as a man \\'warm and impatient, readily provoked, and when irritated, not easily soothed\\'.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nFamily\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nIn 1771, he married Anne Home, daughter of Robert Boyne Home and sister of Sir Everard Home.  They had four children, two of whom died before the age of five.  One of his infant children is buried in the churchyard in Kirkheaton, Northumberland, and the gravestone is Grade II listed.

Anti-fascist protesters, including local Jewish, socialist, anarchist, Irish and communist groups, clashed with the Metropolitan Police, who attempted to remove the barricades erected to stop the march.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nCreation\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nPlanning for the mural began in 1976, when Dan Jones, Secretary of the Hackney Trades Council, saw the Royal Oaks Mural under the Westway in west London, and asked the artist, Dave Binnington, to paint a mural in Cable Street._NEWLINE_A grant from the Arts Council allowed Binnington to undertake research before a public meeting in October 1978 to unveil his design.  The local population were generally supportive, although a letter to a local paper described the proposed mural as \"political graffiti\". Binnington also recruited Paul Butler to design the lower section. Many of the faces in the mural were inspired by newspaper pictures of people who took part in the battle._NEWLINE_Funding from Greater London Arts Association, the E. Vincent Harris Fund for Mural Decoration, the Gulbenkian Foundation, the Leonard Cohen Trust, Greater London Council and the Royal Academy allowed work to start._NEWLINE_Binnington began painting in late 1979 with a targeted completion date of October 1980.  He found it more complicated and time consuming than expected, and work continued through 1980 and 1981.  The uncompleted mural was vandalised on 23 May 1982, when right-wing slogans were painted on lower parts of the wall.  Binnington abandoned the project in disgust.  He later became a furniture designer, and adopted his wife\\'s surname to become David Savage._NEWLINE_Work resumed in July 1982 with Paul Butler helped by Ray Walker and Desmond Rochfort (who had worked with Binnington before on the Royal Oaks Mural).  The top was completed to Binnington\\'s design, and the vandalised lower portions were sand-blasted and repainted to a modified design.  The mural was completed in March 1983 and officially unveiled on 7 May 1983 by Paul Beasley, Leader of Tower Hamlets Council,with Jack Jones (former General Secretary of the Transport and General Workers Union), Tony Banks (Chair of the Greater London Council Arts Committee) and Dan Jones._NEWLINE_The mural has been vandalised and restored several times, and was restored again by Butler for the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Cable Street in October 2011.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nMural\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nThe mural is painted on approximately 3,500 square feet (330\\xc2\\xa0m\\xc2\\xb2) of rendered wall outside 236 Cable Street, E1 0BL, next to Library Place, about 150 yards (140\\xc2\\xa0m) west of Shadwell railway station.

Using a fisheye perspective, it shows the violent confrontation between police and protesters, with protest banners, punches being thrown, a barricade of furniture and overturned vehicle, police horse, and a police autogyro overhead.  It uses the same artistic devices as Goya\\'s The Third of May 1808 to evince sympathy for the protesters, showing them full face but a back view of the police..'</td>\n",

Therefore, the value of smaller prizes usually totals much less than that of the top prize. Firms that rely on sweepstakes for attracting customers, such as Publishers Clearing House and Reader\\'s Digest, have also found that the more involved the entry process, the more entrants. Businesses often obtain marketing information about their customers from sweepstakes entries. Here, products are for free, and the company does not ask for specific knowledge for providing answers in the contests.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nRegulation\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nBecause of their potential for abuse, sweepstakes are heavily regulated in many countries. The US, Canada, and individual US states all have laws covering sweepstakes, so there are special rules depending on where the entrant lives. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission exercises some authority over sweepstakes promotion and sweepstakes scams in the United States. Notably, sweepstakes in Canada, Australia, and several European countries require entrants to solve an elementary-school-level mathematical puzzle or answer a fairly simple knowledge question or solve a trivial fill-in-the-blanks guessing competition, making it (in theory, at least) a contest of skill in order to overcome requirements that would classify sweepstakes as a form of gambling under their country\\'s legal definition. There are similar laws in Brazil, usually requiring an answer to an easy \"giveaway\" question.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nAustralia\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nIn Australia, a sweepstake is known as a competition, however the technical name for a consumer competition is a trade promotion lottery._NEWLINE_A trade promotion lottery is a free entry lottery conducted to promote goods or services supplied by a business. Unlike in the U.S., entrants may be required to purchase a product in order to enter a trade promotion in Australia._NEWLINE_Companies or promoters may require a trade promotion lottery permit if the winner(s) are to be chosen via an element of chance, i.e. a competition draw._NEWLINE_No permits are required for competitions that do not involve an element of chance in determining the winner or winners. Common examples include competitions where entrants are required to submit a photo or an answer to a question in 25 words or less._NEWLINE_Many compers (those who enjoy entering competitions) attend annual national conventions. In 2012 over 100 people from the online competitions website lottos.com.au met on the Gold Coast, Queensland to discuss competitions.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nIreland and the United Kingdom\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nSweepstakes with an entry fee are considered in the UK to be lotteries under the Gambling Act 2005._NEWLINE_Most sweepstakes in the UK are small-scale. They are classed as work lotteries, residents\\' lotteries or private society lotteries and do not require a licence, provided that all the money staked is paid out as prize money._NEWLINE_The popularity of the term \"sweepstakes\" may derive from the Irish Sweepstakes, which were very popular from the 1930s to the 1980s._NEWLINE_There is a tradition of office sweepstakes (known as office pools in the U.S.), which are usually based on major sporting events such as the Grand National and the World Cup. Entrants pay an equal stake for each horse/team they draw out of the hat before the event. The winner then takes the pot. For horse racing events, the pot may be split between the horses which come first, second and third._NEWLINE_What an American would call a \"sweepstakes\" (a random prize draw promoting a commercial product) is likely to be labelled as a \"prize draw\" or \"competition\" in the UK._NEWLINE_In the UK, prize competitions and prize draws are free of statutory control under the Gambling Act 2005  but should follow the CAP Code.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nUnited States\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nIn the United States, sweepstake sponsors are very careful to disassociate themselves from any suggestion that players must pay to enter, or pay to win, since this would constitute gambling. Sweepstakes typically involve enticements to enter a consumer promotion with prizes that range from substantial wins such as cars or large sums of money to smaller prizes that are currently popular with consumers. There should be no monetary cost to the entrant (although some sweepstakes require entrants to subscribe to a promotional mailing list, potentially exposing the entrant to an increase in junk mail, spam email, or telemarketing calls) and sweepstakes winners should also not be required to pay any kind of fee to receive their prizes._NEWLINE_As an example of a state policy on sweepstakes promotions, Tennessee residents are prohibited by a policy of the Tennessee Alcoholic Beverage Commission (and not a state law) from entering sweepstakes online sponsored by manufacturers of wines and liquors; however, Tennessee residents may enter many of these same sweepstakes promotions by entries delivered by the US Postal Service. Another example is that Tennessee state law prohibits sweepstakes agencies and sponsors from requiring sweepstakes prize winners to submit to \"in perpetuity\" publicity releases._NEWLINE_Most corporate-sponsored sweepstakes promoted in the United States limit entry to US citizens, although some allow entry by legal residents of both the United States and Canada._NEWLINE_Among the most popularly known sweepstakes in the United States were the American Family Publishers Sweepstakes (now defunct), Publishers Clearing House sweepstakes, and Reader\\'s Digest Sweepstakes, each of which strongly persuaded entrants to purchase magazine subscriptions by placing stickers on contest entry cardstock while promising multimillion-dollar (annuity) winners who will be \"announced on TV\". The American Family Publishers sweepstakes used paid advertisements during NBC\\'s The Tonight Show to announce its grand prize winners (for many years, its celebrity spokesman was Ed McMahon). All three companies eventually paid fines and penalties to a variety of states who initiated legal actions against them. Of those three companies, only Publishers Clearing House continues to use sweepstakes as a promotional device and as recently as 2010 paid $3.5 million to settle charges that it had violated the terms of a 2001 multi-state agreement for which it was fined $34 million._NEWLINE_Sweepstakes are frequently used by fast-food restaurants to boost business. One of the most popular has been the McDonald\\'s Monopoly \"instant-win\" game-piece promotion (To satisfy the \"no purchase necessary\" requirement, free game pieces are made available on request through the US mail). Soft drink companies also sponsor many sweepstakes, such as the Pepsi Billion Dollar Sweepstakes game and the Pepsi Stuff loyalty rewards program that allowed Pepsi drinkers to accumulate points from packages and cups and redeem them for merchandise. Pepsi Stuff was Pepsi\\'s largest and most successful long-term promotion ever and it ran for many years in the US and in many countries around the world. Other sponsors may require the submission of a UPC of a company product (with provision for receiving a \"free\" UPC) for entry into the sweepstakes drawing._NEWLINE_Sweepstakes parlors, which began to appear in the US around 2005, are establishments that offer chances to win cash prizes as a promotion for a product, usually either a telephone card or Internet access._NEWLINE_Sweepstakes must be carefully planned to comply with local laws and curtail forms of entrant fraud and abuse. Before home computers were popular, a common method of entry was a mailed, plain 3\" \\xc3\\x97 5\" index card with the entrant\\'s name and address. Massive computer-printed entries resulted in a new requirement that entries must be \"hand-printed\". Laser printers that can mimic ink pen writing are also a problem for sponsors. In most sweepstakes, entrants and their relatives must not be related to the sponsor or promoter._NEWLINE_Many state lotteries also run second-chance sweepstakes in conjunction with the retail sale of state lottery scratch cards in an effort to increase consumer demand for scratch cards and help control the litter caused by the improper disposal of non-winning lottery tickets. Since lottery tickets are considered to be bearer instruments under the Uniform Commercial Code, these lottery scratch card promotions can be entered with non-winning tickets that are picked up as litter.'</td>\n",

According to Gregg Brazinsky, author of \"Nation Building in South Korea: Koreans, Americans, and the Making of a Democracy\", Nixon stated that \"the United States would assist in the defense and developments of allies and friends\", but would not \"undertake all the defense of the free nations of the world.\" This doctrine meant that each ally nation was in charge of its own security in general, but the United States would act as a nuclear umbrella when requested. The Doctrine argued for the pursuit of peace through a partnership with American allies.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nBackground\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nAt the time of President Nixon\\'s first inauguration in January 1969, the US had been engaged in combat in Vietnam for almost four years. The war had so far killed over 30,000 Americans and several hundred thousand Vietnamese citizens. By 1969, US public opinion had moved decisively to favoring ending the Vietnam War; a Gallup poll in May showed 56% of the public believed sending troops to Vietnam was a mistake. Of those over 50 years old, 61% expressed that belief, compared to 49% of those between ages 21 and 29, even if tacit abandonment of the SEATO Treaty was ultimately required and caused a complete Communist takeover of South Vietnam despite previous US guarantees. Because Nixon campaigned for \"Peace with Honor\" in relation to Vietnam during the 1968 presidential campaign, ending the Vietnam War became an important policy goal for him.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nThe Nixon Doctrine\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nDuring a stopover during an international tour on the U.S. Territory of Guam, Nixon formally announced the Doctrine. Nixon declared the United States would honor all of its treaty commitments in Asia, but \"as far as the problems of international security are concerned ... the United States is going to encourage and has a right to expect that this problem will increasingly be handled by, and the responsibility for it taken by, the Asian nations themselves\". _NEWLINE__NEWLINE_Later, from the Oval Office in an address to the nation on the War in Vietnam on November 3, 1969, Nixon said:_NEWLINE_First, the United States will keep all of its treaty commitments._NEWLINE_Second, we shall provide a shield if a nuclear power threatens the freedom of a nation allied with us or of a nation whose survival we consider vital to our security._NEWLINE__NEWLINE_Third, in cases involving other types of aggression, we shall furnish military and economic assistance when requested in accordance with our treaty commitments. But we shall look to the nation directly threatened to assume the primary responsibility of providing the manpower for its defense.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nDoctrine in practice\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nThe Doctrine was exemplified by the Vietnamization process regarding South Vietnam and the Vietnam War.  It also played elsewhere in Asia including Iran,  Taiwan, Cambodia  and South Korea.  The doctrine was an explicit rejection of the practice that sent 500,000 American soldiers to Vietnam, even though there was no treaty obligation to that country.  A major long-term goal was to reduce the tension between the United States and the Soviet Union and mainland China, so as to better enable the policy of d\\xc3\\xa9tente to work.   _NEWLINE_The particular Asian nation the Nixon Doctrine was aimed at with its message that Asian nations should be responsible for defending themselves was South Vietnam, but Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi of Iran seized upon the Nixon Doctrine with its message that Asian nations should be responsible for their own defense to argue that the Americans should sell him arms without limitations, a suggestion that Nixon eagerly embraced. The US turned to Saudi Arabia and Iran as \"twin pillars\" of regional stability. Oil price increases in 1970 and 1971 would allow funding both states with this military expansion. Total arms transfers from the United States to Iran increased from $103.6 million in 1970 to $552.7 million in 1972; those to Saudi Arabia increased from $15.8 million in 1970 to $312.4 million in 1972. The United States would maintain its small naval force of three ships in the Gulf, stationed since World War II in Bahrain, but would take on no other formal security commitments._NEWLINE_One factor in reducing open-ended American commitments was financial concern.  Vietnam had proven very expensive.  In South Korea, 20,000 of the 61,000 US troops stationed there were withdrawn by June 1971._NEWLINE_The application of the Nixon Doctrine \"opened the floodgates\" of US military aid to allies in the Persian Gulf.  That in turn helped set the stage for the Carter Doctrine and for the subsequent direct US military involvement of the Gulf War and the Iraq War.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nContemporary usage\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nScholar Walter Ladwig has recently argued that the United States should adopt a \"neo-Nixon doctrine\" towards the Indian Ocean region, in which the US would sponsor key local partners\\xe2\\x80\\x94India, Indonesia, Australia and South Africa\\xe2\\x80\\x94to assume the primary burden for upholding regional peace and security. A key shortcoming of the original Nixon Doctrine, Ladwig argues, was its reliance on pro-Western autocrats who proved to be a poor foundation for an enduring regional security structure. In contrast, his \"neo-Nixon Doctrine\" would focus on cultivating the major Indian Ocean nations that are democratic and financially capable of being net providers of security in the region. Although crediting this idea for the \"reasonable balance it strikes between US leadership and local initiative\", Andrew Philips of the Australian Strategic Policy Institute has suggested the idea overstates \"the degree of convergent security interests between its four presumptive sub-regional lynchpin states.\"'</td>\n",

The route proceeds generally northeastward along Phelps Way, a four-lane, divided highway bypass of Sleepy Hollow and Kykuit, the Rockefeller family's estate. For its first 2 miles (3.2\\xc2\\xa0km), the highway runs through a wooded area along the northern edge of the Rockefeller State Park Preserve, crossing under several of the park's hiking and walking trails. Phelps Way ends at the northeastern tip of the park, where NY\\xc2\\xa0117 intersects with the northern terminus of NY\\xc2\\xa0448 at Bedford Road. While NY\\xc2\\xa0448 ends here, Bedford Road continues on as part of NY\\xc2\\xa0117._NEWLINE_After NY\\xc2\\xa0448, NY\\xc2\\xa0117 becomes a four-lane, undivided at-grade street as it heads northeast through a residential area of Mount Pleasant. Just past the NY\\xc2\\xa0448 junction, NY\\xc2\\xa0117 enters adjacent interchanges with Saw Mill River Road (NY\\xc2\\xa09A and NY\\xc2\\xa0100) and the northbound direction of the Taconic State Parkway near Graham Hills County Park. From here, the highway passes south of Pace University's Pleasantville campus on its way into the village of Pleasantville, where it narrows to two lanes and initially serves mostly commercial neighborhoods. NY\\xc2\\xa0117 remains on Bedford Road for its first few blocks in Pleasantville; however, it veers northeast onto Manville Road just southwest of the community's central business district._NEWLINE_As Manville Road, the highway heads past five residential blocks, connecting to the southbound direction of the Saw Mill River Parkway before entering Pleasantville's commercial center at Memorial Plaza. Within Memorial Plaza is Metro-North Railroad's Pleasantville station, located on the south side of NY\\xc2\\xa0117. After crossing the Metro-North tracks, the route continues east along several commercial blocks before turning to the northeast and entering another residential section of Pleasantville. The highway eventually reaches the northern edge of the village, where it rejoins Bedford Road at a junction with the northern terminus of NY\\xc2\\xa0141. NY\\xc2\\xa0117 turns north here, following Bedford Road out of Pleasantville and into the nearby town of New Castle.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nNew Castle, Chappaqua and Mount Kisco\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nUpon crossing into New Castle, NY\\xc2\\xa0117 changes names to South Bedford Road. The road takes a generally northeasterly track away from the town line to the hamlet of Chappaqua, a community just 2 miles (3.2\\xc2\\xa0km) from the center of Pleasantville. NY\\xc2\\xa0117 serves as Chappaqua's main north\\xe2\\x80\\x93south street, passing by commercial and residential neighborhoods ahead of an intersection with NY\\xc2\\xa0120 (King Street) in Chappaqua's center. NY\\xc2\\xa0120 turns north here, overlapping with NY\\xc2\\xa0117 for one block before splitting off to the west on Quaker Road. NY\\xc2\\xa0117 continues north from this point as North Bedford Road, passing a strip mall before leaving Chappaqua._NEWLINE_Outside of Chappaqua, NY\\xc2\\xa0117 loosely parallels the Saw Mill River Parkway as it winds its way northeastward across residential parts of New Castle. The two parallel roads connect again by way of Roaring Brook Road, a four-lane arterial located midway between Chappaqua and the next community along NY\\xc2\\xa0117, the village of Mount Kisco. Roaring Brook Road also connects NY\\xc2\\xa0117 and the Saw Mill River Parkway to the global headquarters of Reader's Digest, which comprises a large complex bounded by NY\\xc2\\xa0117 to the east and the Metro-North tracks to the west. From here, NY\\xc2\\xa0117 takes on a more pronounced northeasterly alignment that takes the route past Mount Kisco Country Club and into the village of Mount Kisco._NEWLINE_Just inside the village limits, NY\\xc2\\xa0117 meets the north end of NY\\xc2\\xa0128 at Park Avenue. Past Park Avenue, NY\\xc2\\xa0117 continues north through Mount Kisco, changing names to Main Street ahead of the village's central business district. Here, the route enters a junction with the western terminus of NY\\xc2\\xa0172 (South Bedford Road) at the main entrance to Northern Westchester Hospital. The commercial surroundings continue north for another eight blocks to Jeff Feigel Square, where NY\\xc2\\xa0117 connects to the east end of NY\\xc2\\xa0133. Main Street turns northwest onto NY\\xc2\\xa0133 while NY\\xc2\\xa0117 splits to the northeast along Bedford Road.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nMount Kisco, Bedford, and Bedford Hills\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nAs the route heads away from Main Street, it proceeds through a brief wooded, residential area before entering a commercial district surrounding Mount Kisco Commons. Several businesses and an industrial complex follow after as NY\\xc2\\xa0117 continues northeast through the northernmost part of Mount Kisco and into the town of Bedford. Across the town line, the development along the route remains commercial as the road parallels the nearby railroad tracks and the Saw Mill River Parkway to the northwest. About 2 miles (3.2\\xc2\\xa0km) from Mount Kisco, NY\\xc2\\xa0117 enters the hamlet of Bedford Hills, where the route initially serves residential neighborhoods._NEWLINE_In the commercial center of the community, NY\\xc2\\xa0117 serves the Bedford Hills Metro-North station before widening to four lanes as it crosses the railroad tracks and connects to exit\\xc2\\xa039 of the Saw Mill River Parkway. For the next mile (1.6\\xc2\\xa0km), NY\\xc2\\xa0117 runs alongside the northern edge of the Saw Mill River Parkway as it heads through another residential part of Bedford Hills as a two-lane road. At Harris Road, the route turns southeastward, crossing the parkway and the adjacent railroad tracks again as it intersects with the parkway's exit\\xc2\\xa042. NY\\xc2\\xa0117's southeastward run on Harris Road ends just past the railroad crossing, where the highway turns northeast onto an unnamed road leading to a commercial and industrial area south of the hamlet of Katonah. After turning onto the highway, NY\\xc2\\xa0117 serves various businesses before the route ends at the southbound-only exit\\xc2\\xa043 of the Saw Mill River Parkway. NY\\xc2\\xa0117 northbound feeds into the northbound direction of the parkway, while exit\\xc2\\xa043 serves as the start of NY\\xc2\\xa0117 southbound.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nOrigins and local realignments\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nNY\\xc2\\xa0117 was assigned as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York. It initially began at the junction of Bedford and County House Roads in Tarrytown (both part of NY\\xc2\\xa09A at the time) and followed Bedford Road northeast to NY\\xc2\\xa0132 (now NY\\xc2\\xa035) at Jay Street in Katonah. NY\\xc2\\xa09A was realigned c.\\xe2\\x80\\x891939 to follow Sleepy Hollow Road instead, bypassing Tarrytown completely. The former routing of NY\\xc2\\xa09A on Bedford Road to US\\xc2\\xa09 became a short extension of NY\\xc2\\xa0117. The route was also extended on its northern end in the mid-1970s after NY\\xc2\\xa035 was moved onto a new highway that bypassed Katonah to the north._NEWLINE_On September\\xc2\\xa01, 1980, ownership and maintenance of NY\\xc2\\xa0117 between Manville Road southwest of the Pleasantville village limits and Broadway within Pleasantville was transferred from the state of New York to Westchester County as part of a highway maintenance swap between the two levels of government. In return, ownership and maintenance of the entirety of Manville Road through Pleasantville was given to the state of New York from Westchester County. NY\\xc2\\xa0117 was rerouted to follow Manville Road while NY\\xc2\\xa0141 was extended one block north along NY\\xc2\\xa0117's former routing to intersect Manville Road. The remainder of NY\\xc2\\xa0117's former routing is now County Route\\xc2\\xa027A (CR\\xc2\\xa027A) from Manville Road to the Pleasantville village line, part of CR\\xc2\\xa0106 from View Street to Pleasantville Road, and CR\\xc2\\xa027 from the Mount Pleasant village line to View Street and from Pleasantville Road to NY\\xc2\\xa0141.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nPhelps Way\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nThe portion of NY\\xc2\\xa0117's original routing between Tarrytown and Pleasantville passed through the center of Kykuit, the estate of the Rockefeller family, and was designed to handle 1,900 cars per day. The actual volume of traffic on the roadway was much higher as the actual average annual daily traffic reached upwards of 5,000 vehicles per day. As a result, the Rockefeller family looked into having the route realigned as early as 1932. The family suggested that a new highway be built along the northern end of the estate._NEWLINE_In 1965, Rockefeller unveiled plans for the Potantico Expressway, a connector from the to-be-constructed Hudson River Expressway (NY\\xc2\\xa09A) to the Taconic State Parkway. Some opposition to the idea arose on the grounds that the new highway would only benefit the Rockefeller estate and not the residents. Nonetheless, construction began on the Potantico Expressway (now known as Phelps Way) in 1969. When the highway was completed in November\\xc2\\xa01970, it became part of a rerouted NY\\xc2\\xa0117. NY\\xc2\\xa0117's former alignment along Bedford Road became NY\\xc2\\xa0448. The Hudson River Expressway project was cancelled in 1971, and the western stub of the expressway now serves Phelps Hospital.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nKatonah Bypass\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nThe easternmost portion of NY\\xc2\\xa0117 in Katonah passed through a historic district containing several homes dating back to the late 19th century. Following the construction of nearby I-684 in 1968, this segment of NY\\xc2\\xa0117 became a truck route between the Interstate Highway and industrial areas along NY\\xc2\\xa0117 south of Katonah. While the Saw Mill River Parkway would have provided an alternate route to I-684 from NY\\xc2\\xa0117, commercial traffic was prohibited from using the highway. The trucks that used NY\\xc2\\xa0117 would shake the historic homes as it passed through the hamlet, causing small amounts of damage to the structures. A study analyzing the issue of truck traffic along NY\\xc2\\xa0117 in Katonah began in 1976 at the request of the town of Bedford._NEWLINE_The study was completed in 1978, at which time the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) concluded that traffic would never become heavy enough along NY\\xc2\\xa0117 to bring about a need for a bypass. However, the state continued to keep abreast of the situation and eventually performed a second study in 1983. Unlike the first study, this one found traffic along the highway to be on the rise. As a result, the state began making plans to construct a bypass that would divert truck traffic away from Katonah. Over the next three years, NYSDOT proposed a total of nine different routings for the bypass. The route selected by the town of Bedford would begin at Harris Road and head north and east to the Saw Mill Parkway, which it would merge into. An exception would then be made to allow commercial traffic on the parkway between the Katonah Bypass and I-684. The routing of the highway, projected to cost $8.7 million (equivalent to $19.2\\xc2\\xa0million in 2019), was approved in November 1987._NEWLINE_In October 1990, NYSDOT accepted a low bid of $8.5 million (equivalent to $16.3\\xc2\\xa0million in 2019) for the project, clearing the way for construction to begin on the bypass by the following month. The Katonah Bypass opened c.\\xe2\\x80\\x891992 and became part of a realigned NY\\xc2\\xa0117. The portion of Bedford Road from Harris Road to NY\\xc2\\xa035 is now maintained by the town of Bedford.\"</td>\n",

At the age of five, Norbu, as he was then known, was recognized as an incarnate lama, and on his 6th birthday he was taken to his labrang (a lama\\'s residence). He became a monk and studied at Rato Monastery, later moving to Drepung Monastery, where he received his Lharampa Geshe degree (equivalent to Doctor of Divinity), and finally to Gyuto Tantric University, where he served as abbot._NEWLINE_In 1958, the 14th Dalai Lama was taking the examinations for his Lharampa Geshe degree. Khyongla Rato was asked to be one of two scholars who, during Monlam, would represent Rato Monastery as debating challengers in the Dalai Lama\\'s final examination at the Jokhang. Altogether there were eighty challengers from ten monasteries. As Khyongla Rato says in his autobiography, on page 233, when it was his turn to debate, \"For half an hour our thrilling interchange continued until the senior tutor, my good friend Ling Rinpoche, raised his hand and I returned to my place, exceedingly joyful and relieved.\"_NEWLINE_A photographic exhibition featuring Khyongla Rinpoche, Return to the Roof of the World, was held at the Leica Gallery in New York in 2011. It follows Nicholas Vreeland\\'s journey as a photographer while accompanying his teacher on his return to his birthplace in Dagyab, eastern Tibet, 50 years after he had left.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nTeachers\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nKhyongla Rato Rinpoche studied with over 70 teachers, including Konchok Gyatso, Geshe Yeshe Loden, and from the age of 25 with Kyabje Ling Rinpoche, the senior tutor of the 14th Dalai Lama. While  Khyongla Rinpoche was still quite young, he attended a teaching from Pabongkhapa D\\xc3\\xa9chen Nyingpo, and this served as a significant inspiration to him.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nPublications\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nWhile first in India, at the request of the Dalai Lama, Khyongla Rato Rinpoche helped to write texts on the grammar, literature, history and religion of Tibet; these were used in the education of the families of Tibetan exiles. In the 1970s, as a result of urging from his students, Khyongla Rato wrote an autobiography, My Life and Lives; the book focuses primarily on his years in Tibet. Joseph Campbell, the American mythologist, edited the book and wrote the introduction.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nThe Tibet Center\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nIn 1975, Khyongla Rato founded The Tibet Center in New York City. The center is also known as Kunkhyab Thardo Ling (translation: Land pervaded with Seekers of Liberation), a name that was given to the center by Ling Rinpoche. Khyongla Rato has taught at the Tibet Center for almost 40 years._NEWLINE_Over the years many different teachers have taught at The Tibet Center, including not only high lamas from Tibetan Buddhism, but also Buddhists from the Chan, Theravadan and Zen traditions, as well as teachers from the Jain, Hindu and Christian religions, and scientists and philosophers._NEWLINE_After its founding, Khyongla Rato was for many years the director of The Tibet Center. The current director is one of his students, Geshe Nicholas Vreeland, the subject of the documentary film Monk With A Camera.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nFilms\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nDespite having no prior acting experience, Khyongla Rato was asked to portray a monk in the filming of Little Buddha, directed by Bernardo Bertolucci and released in 1993. Khyongla Rato consulted the Dalai Lama, who told him he should go ahead and do this, so he ended up playing the role of the abbot of the Tibetan Buddhist monastery in Bhutan._NEWLINE_Kyongla Rato Rinpoche has considerable screen time in the 2014 documentary Monk with a Camera, because he is the \"root guru\" of Nicholas Vreeland, the subject of the film.'</td>\n",

Uses include filling, spacing, joining, or reinforcing members. Blocking is typically made from short off-cuts or defective, warped pieces of lumber.  Names for similar materials in other forms of English include dwang, nog, noggin, and nogging._NEWLINE_The term Blocking is also sometimes used by people in construction to refer to discontinuous shims or spacers.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nUses\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nSome blocking is used structurally like cross bracing between joists in a subfloor to prevent buckling and stiffen the floor. This use is also called block bridging, solid bridging, and solid strutting._NEWLINE_Fire-blocking is a firestop._NEWLINE_Blocks are spacers between studs such as where an interior wall attaches an exterior wall and for framing corners such as a \"three-stud corner with blocking\"._NEWLINE_Blocking is used for panel edge supports such as sheets of drywall or plywood also called back blocking_NEWLINE_Blocking, often called backing or sometimes grounds, also refers to pieces of wood or other material that run between wall studs in order to provide support and attachment sites for mounted hardware or trim such as cabinets, shelving, handrails, vanity tops without a cabinet underneath, bathroom towel bars, mouldings etc. Properly installed blocking is easier to find and use for attaching wall hardware than studs alone. Once drywall, or any other material, covers the wall it can be difficult to find 2x4 studs for attachment, and the position of nails and screws must be adjusted to stud location. Thus, if blocking is installed at a uniform and predetermined height, attachment sites can be found without using a stud finder, and the blocking can be utilized anywhere along a wall at that height. This is particularly useful for installing upper cabinets in kitchens or bathrooms as they tend to be fairly heavy and finding appropriate studs for installation can be difficult.'</td>\n",

It is a giant version of a traditional Swedish Yule Goat figure made of straw. It is erected each year at the beginning of Advent over a period of two days by local community groups, and has become famous for being destroyed in arson attacks during December. Despite security measures and the nearby presence of a fire station, the goat has been burned to the ground most years since its first appearance in 1966. As of December 2017, the goat has been damaged 37 times._NEWLINE_Since 1986 two Yule Goats have been built in G\\xc3\\xa4vle: the G\\xc3\\xa4vle Goat by the Southern Merchants and the Yule Goat built by the Natural Science Club of the School of Vasa.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nHistory\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nThe G\\xc3\\xa4vle Goat is erected every year on the first day of Advent, which according to Western Christian tradition is in late November or early December, depending on the calendar year. In 1966, an advertising consultant, Stig Gavl\\xc3\\xa9n (1927-2018), came up with the idea of making a giant version of the traditional Swedish Yule Goat and placing it in the square. The design of the first goat was assigned to the then chief of the G\\xc3\\xa4vle fire department, Gavl\\xc3\\xa9n\\'s brother J\\xc3\\xb6rgen Gavl\\xc3\\xa9n. The construction of the goat was carried out by the fire department, and they erected the goat each year from 1966 to 1970 and from 1986 to 2002. The first goat was financed by Harry Str\\xc3\\xb6m. On 1 December 1966, a 13-metre (43\\xc2\\xa0ft) tall, 7-metre (23\\xc2\\xa0ft) long, 3-tonne goat was erected in the square. On New Year\\'s Eve, the goat was burnt down, and the perpetrator was found and convicted of vandalism. The goat was insured, and Str\\xc3\\xb6m got all of his money back._NEWLINE_A group of businessmen known as the Southern Merchants (S\\xc3\\xb6ders K\\xc3\\xb6pm\\xc3\\xa4n) financed the building of the goat in subsequent years. In 1971, the Southern Merchants stopped building the goats. The Natural Science Club (Naturvetenskapliga F\\xc3\\xb6reningen) of the School of Vasa (Vasaskolan) began building the structure. Their goat was around 2 metres (6.6\\xc2\\xa0ft). Due to the positive reaction their Yule Goat received that year, they built another one the following year and from then on. The Southern Merchants began building their own goats again in 1986._NEWLINE_The cost for the 1966 goat was SEK 10,000. The price tag for constructing the goat in 2005 was around 100,000 Swedish kronor. The city pays one-third of the cost while the Southern Merchants pay the remaining sum. Since 2003 the construction of the goat has been undertaken by a group of unemployed people known as ALU workers._NEWLINE_The display has become notable for being a recurring target for vandalism by arson, and has been destroyed many times since the first goat was erected in 1966. Because the fire station is close to the location of the goat, most of the time the fire can be extinguished before the wooden skeleton is severely damaged. If the goat is burned down before December 13th, the feast day of Saint Lucia, the goat is rebuilt. The skeleton is then treated and repaired, and the goat reconstructed over it, using straw which the Goat Committee has pre-ordered. As of 2005, four people have been caught or convicted for vandalizing the goat. In 2001, the goat was burned down by a 51-year-old visitor from Cleveland, Ohio in the United States, who spent 18 days in jail and was subsequently convicted and ordered to pay 100,000 Swedish kronor in damages. The court confiscated his cigarette lighter with the argument that he clearly was not able to handle it. He stated in court that he was no \"goat burner\", and believed that he was taking part in a completely legal goat-burning tradition. After he was released from jail he returned to the US without paying his fine._NEWLINE_In 1996, the Southern Merchants introduced camera surveillance to monitor the goat 24 hours a day. On 27 November 2004 the G\\xc3\\xa4vle Goat\\'s homepage was hacked into and one of the two official webcams changed. One year, while security guards were posted around the goat in order to prevent further vandalism, the temperature dropped far below zero. As the guards ducked into a nearby restaurant to escape the cold, the vandals struck._NEWLINE_During the weekend of 3\\xe2\\x80\\x934 December 2005 a series of attacks on public Yule Goats across Sweden were carried out; The G\\xc3\\xa4vle Goat was burnt on 3 December. The Visby goat on Gotland burned down, the Yule Goat in S\\xc3\\xb6derk\\xc3\\xb6ping, \\xc3\\x96sterg\\xc3\\xb6tland was torched, and there was an attack on a goat located in Lycksele, V\\xc3\\xa4sterbotten. _NEWLINE_The Christmas season of 2006 marked the 40th anniversary of the G\\xc3\\xa4vle Goat, and, on Sunday 3 December, the city held a large celebration in honor of the goat. The Goat Committee fireproofed the goat with \"Fiber ProTector Fireproof\", a fireproofing substance that is used in airplanes. In earlier years when the goat had been fireproofed, the dew had made the liquid drip off the goat. To prevent this from happening in 2006, \"Fireproof ProTechtor Solvent Base\" was applied to the goat. Despite their efforts, the goat has been destroyed a total of 36 times, including the most recent incident, on 27 November 2016, when an arsonist equipped with petrol burned it down, just hours after its inauguration.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nNatural Science Club\\'s Yule Goat\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nSince 1986 there have been two Yule Goats built in G\\xc3\\xa4vle: the G\\xc3\\xa4vle Goat by the Southern Merchants and the Yule Goat built by the Natural Science Club of the School of Vasa. Until 1985 the Southern Merchants held the world record for the largest Yule Goat, but over the years the Natural Science Club\\'s goat increased in size, and in 1985 their Yule Goat made it into the Guinness Book of Records with an official height of 12.5 metres (41\\xc2\\xa0ft). The creator of the original 1966 goat, Stig Gavl\\xc3\\xa9n, thought that the Natural Science Club\\'s goat had unfairly won the title of the largest Yule Goat because the goat was not as attractive as the Southern Merchants\\' goat and the neck was excessively long. The next year there was a Goat war: the Southern Merchants understood the publicity value, and erected a huge goat, the Natural Science Club erected a smaller one in protest. The Southern Merchants had intended that their huge goat would reclaim the world record, but the measurement of the goat showed it fell short. Over the following seven years there were no further attempts on the world record, but there was some hostility between the Natural Science Club and the Southern Merchants, evidenced by the fact that the Natural Science Club put up a sign near their goat wishing a Merry Christmas to everyone, except the Southern Merchants._NEWLINE_In 1993 the Southern Merchants again announced that they were going to attempt the world record. The goat stood 10.5 metres (34\\xc2\\xa0ft) when completed. The Natural Science Club\\'s Yule Goat that year measured 14.9 metres (49\\xc2\\xa0ft), which earned them another place in the Guinness Book of Records.'</td>\n",

The north and west half of the reserve are forested, and the south and east are riverine wetlands.  80% of the territory is in the lowlands of the Kerzhenets river basin.  The bedrock is Permian clay, marl and limestone overlain by 5 to 30 meters of alluvial sediments.  The banks of the tributaries of the Kerzhenets are marked by outcrops of carbonate rocks.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nClimate and Ecoregion\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nKerzhinski is located in the Scandinavian and Russian taiga ecoregion.  This is situated in Northern Europe between tundra in the north and temperate mixed forests in the south.  It is covers parts of Norway, Sweden, Finland and the northern part of European Russia, being the largest ecoregion in Europe.  Coniferous forests dominated by Pinus sylvestris (in drier locations), often with an understory of Juniperus communis, Picea abies and Picea obovata and a significant admixture of Betula pubescens and Betula pendula. Larix sibirica is characteristic of the eastern part of the ecoregion._NEWLINE_The climate of Kerzhinski is Humid continental climate, cool summer (K\\xc3\\xb6ppen climate classification (Dfb)). This climate is characterized by large swings in temperature, both diurnally and seasonally, with mild summers and cold, snowy winters. The average January temperature is -12 C, July is 19 C.  Annual precipitation averages 550\\xc2\\xa0mm.  Winds in the summer are from the northwest, but from the south and west the remainder of the year.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nFlora and fauna\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nThe landscape displays features of Eastern European mixed forest, particularly peat bogs, pine forests (60% of the territory) and alder-birch forests (35% of the reserve) in the lower wetter regions, with associated plants and animals.  The remainder of the landscape is swamp and transitional mire.  The area was subject to extensive tree loss (to logging and fires, particularly a disastrous fire in 1972 that killed 20% of the trees), so the stands are mostly middle-aged or younger.  A recent study of the reserve recorded 103 species of algae, 283 of mushrooms, 205 of lichens, 160 of bryophytes and 593 species of vascular plants._NEWLINE_Because the reserve is in a transitional zone on the edges of three regions - taiga, broadleaf forest, and steppe - it has animals that are representative of each.   Taiga species include caribou, wolverine and squirrel.  Broadleaf forests to the west contribute martens, minks, and wood mice. Steppe species include voles, hedgehogs, and field mice. Throughout are the larger mammals of the woods: wolf, fox, badger, stoat, weasel, and bear.  Part of the work of the reserve is experimenting with the re-introduction and recovery of species that have been lost to the territory.  Current reintroduction efforts are focused on the muskrat, the Willow ptarmigan, and the forest reindeer.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nEcotourism\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nAs a strict nature reserve, the Kerzhenski Reserve is mostly closed to the general public, although scientists and those with 'environmental education' purposes can make arrangements with park management for visits. There are three main 'ecotourist' routes that have been developed for tourists: a floodplain tour, a swamp tour, and a forest tour. The reserve has also opened a visitor center.  The main office is in the town of Rustai.\"</td>\n",

It was named for James Bertie, his brother Henry Bertie, or perhaps both, each having been one of the Lords Proprietors of Carolina._NEWLINE_In 1729 parts of Bertie Precinct, Chowan Precinct, Currituck Precinct, and Pasquotank Precinct of Albemarle County were combined to form Tyrrell Precinct. With the abolition of Albemarle County in 1739, all of its constituent precincts became separate counties. As population of settlers increased, in 1741 parts of Bertie County were organized as Edgecombe County and Northampton County. Finally, in 1759 parts of Bertie, Chowan, and Northampton counties were combined to form Hertford County. Bertie's boundaries have remained the same since then._NEWLINE_This mostly rural county depended on the agricultural economy well into the 20th century. In the colonial and antebellum eras, tobacco and cotton were the chief commodity crops, worked by enslaved African Americans. After the Civil War, agriculture continued to be important to the county. In the 21st century, developers have referred to it as being within the Inner Banks region, which is increasingly attracting retirees and buyers of second homes, because of its beaches and lovely landscapes.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nGeography\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of 741 square miles (1,920\\xc2\\xa0km\\xc2\\xb2), of which 699 square miles (1,810\\xc2\\xa0km\\xc2\\xb2) is land and 42 square miles (110\\xc2\\xa0km\\xc2\\xb2) (5.7%) is water.\"</td>\n",

Rather than evolving from simpler organisms, humanity was of extraterrestrial origin and other organisms evolved from us (p.\\xc2\\xa07). From this base, humanity developed boat-building in Southeast Asia and colonised the rest of the planet (p.\\xc2\\xa015). There is evidence that the Bronze Age began in Southeast Asia (p.\\xc2\\xa017). Fuller\\'s Dymaxion World Map is used to show the distribution of humanity over the Earth\\'s surface. Over half the population lives in the regions watered by the Himalayan glaciers (p.\\xc2\\xa020).\\n_START_SECTION_\\nChapter 2 - Humans in Universe\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nOur knowledge of the spherical shape of the Earth is central to our understanding of ecology (p.\\xc2\\xa034). This knowledge probably originated in prehistoric times, was certainly known to the Ancient Greeks, but was then suppressed for centuries by organised religion because it was incompatible with the official story of a Heaven above and a Hell below (p.\\xc2\\xa043). There has been an evolution of religious ideas from those of the Egyptian pyramid-builders, whose ambition was to deliver a single individual, the pharaoh, into the afterlife, to the modern belief that everybody has a right to enjoy life on Earth (p.\\xc2\\xa051).\\n_START_SECTION_\\nChapter 3 - Legally Piggily\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nFire is the Sun unwinding from the tree\\'s log._NEWLINE_\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\xe2\\x80\\x89Fuller, p.62_NEWLINE_Human history has been shaped by the continual growth and success of greed. City-states were the first institutions to make organised use of extortion (p.\\xc2\\xa068). This was then followed by the growth of international trade, which appropriates the wealth of the planet for its own ends. Corruption in the form of \"lawyer-capitalism\" has led the U.S.A. to become effectively bankrupt (p.\\xc2\\xa0114), with the common people obliged to fund the profitmaking activity of corporations.

The mechanical principle of precession is used as a metaphor for the ability of a person to influence the world by applying pressure in an unconventional direction (p.\\xc2\\xa0144). Fuller\\'s religious beliefs are explained (p.\\xc2\\xa0151)._NEWLINE_Fuller observed that when he did things for the benefit of others, it had a positive effect on his life, but when he did things merely for his personal benefit, the outcome was negative. This eventually led him to the proposition that if he dedicated his life to the betterment of humanity, he would achieve the greatest positive outcome. So he decided to live his entire life as an experiment to prove or disprove this proposition. He writes (p.\\xc2\\xa0145):_NEWLINE_I assumed that nature would \"evaluate\" my work as I went along. If I was doing what nature wanted done, and if I was doing it in promising ways, permitted by nature\\'s principles, I would find my work being economically sustained\\xe2\\x80\\x94and vice versa, in which latter negative case I must quickly cease doing what I had been doing and seek logically alternative courses until I found the new course that nature signified her approval of by providing for its physical support. Wherefore, I concluded that I would be informed by nature if I proceeded in the following manner:_NEWLINE_(A) committed myself, my wife, and our infant daughter directly to the design, production, and demonstration of artifact accommodation of the most evident but as-yet-unattended-to human-environment-advantaging physical evolutionary tasks, and (B) paid no attention to \"earning a living\" in humanity\\'s established economic system, yet (C) found my family\\'s and my own life\\'s needs being unsolicitedly provided for by seemingly pure happenstance and always only \"in the nick of time,\" and (D) being provided for \"only coincidentally,\" yet found (E) that this only \"coincidentally,\" unbudgetable, yet realistic support persisted, and did so (F) only so long as I continued spontaneously to commit myself unreservedly to the task of developing relevant artifacts, and if I (G) never tried to persuade humanity to alter its customs and viewpoints and never asked anyone to listen to me and spoke informatively to others only when they asked me so to do, and if I (H) never undertook competitively to produce artifacts others were developing, and attended only to that which no others attended_NEWLINE_then I could tentatively conclude that my two assumptions were valid: (1) that nature might economically sustain human activity that served directly in the \"mainstream\" realization of essential cosmic regeneration, which had hitherto been accomplished only through seeming \"right-angled\" side effects of the chromosomically focused biological creatures; and (2) that the generalized physical law of precessional behaviors does govern socioeconomic behaviors as do also the generalized laws of acceleration and ephemeralization.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nChapter 5 - The Geoscope\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nThe Geoscope is a large-scale, animated globe of the Earth intended to help people visualise the spatial and temporal patterns of human activity, either in real time or replayed at different speeds.

In 1850 surveyor Hugh Roland Labatt arrived in Maryborough with instructions to \"examine the River Mary ... to suggest ...t he best site or sites for the laying out of the town, having regard to the convenience of shipping on one hand and internal communication on the other ... also ... point out the spots desirable as reserves for public building, church, quay and for places for public recreation.\" The site recommended by Labatt was not where settlement was established but further east and from the early 1850s this is where the growing town developed. During the 1860s an 1870s, Maryborough flourished as the principal port of Gympie where gold was discovered in 1867._NEWLINE_Andrew Heron Wilson arrived in Maryborough in about 1866 and established the Maryborough Sawmills, where he worked for many years before joining in partnership R Hart and J Bartholemew, and constructing a larger sawmill for Wilson, Hart and Co., as the partnership was known, in 1881. He retired from milling after only two years at his new mill. Wilson was a large investor in Gympie gold mining and was a director of the Monkland South Glanmire Company and also of the Maryborough Building Society. He was a member of the Queensland Legislative Council from 19 September 1883 until his death on 29 August 1906._NEWLINE_In about 1882 Wilson acquired the property on which he constructed his residence, a large timber house, known as Doon Villa overlooking the Mary River. This was an impressive house and an early history of Maryborough considers it one of the residential jewels of Maryborough, and indeed of Queensland. Wilson planned an impressive garden around the house. He constructed a bowling green for use by a lawn bowls club at his home, the oldest in Queensland._NEWLINE_In 1889 Wilson and his wife went on an extended holiday, first to England and then to New Zealand, where they visited Mrs Wilson\\'s sister, Margaret Blair and her children. Margaret Blair\\'s husband, Robert, died on 18 February 1893 and his wife and children left New Zealand and went to live with the Wilsons at Doon Villa in Maryborough. Wilson is thought to have managed the construction of a new house, called Blairholme, for his wife\\'s sister and her four children. Wilson purchased the land, being section 2 on Allotment 147, adjacent to Doon Villa\\'s Sections 3 and 4, on which Blairholme was built in 1891 and the house is thought to have been built sometime after Mrs Blair\\'s arrival in 1893. Wilson\\'s involvement with the timber and iron industries in Maryborough may explain the absence of tender notices for the construction of the house, which has made identification of an architect difficult. It is suggested that the architect of Blairholme was from Rockhampton. By 1895 the house was completed and the Blair family were in residence._NEWLINE_The death of Andrew Wilson on 29 August 1906 resulted in his land being transferred to Queensland Trustees Limited as a condition of his will, although it appears that the Blair family remained in the house until 1935 when the allotments were subdivided and sold. Hugh Keys bought the property on which Blairholme stood and, two years later, on 8 March 1937, this property was transferred to James Richard Lambert Hyne, a member of another prominent local timber milling family company._NEWLINE_The Hyne family were descendant from Richard Matthews Hyne who arrived in Maryborough and established himself as the publican of the Royal Hotel in about 1873. Hyne realised that Maryborough was an emerging municipality as the port of the flourishing Wide Bay-Burnett region and Gympie goldfields. He became interested in establishing institutions in the town and helped improved health, education, welfare and recreational facilities in the area. Hyne was mayor of Maryborough for a year in 1878. The Hyne family have a long interest in the local timber milling industry and their family company continues to this day._NEWLINE_The Hyne family had a family home in Lennox Street called Ilfracombe and when they bought Blairholme the name was transferred from this earlier residence. On the death of his father the property was transferred to Warren Henry Hyne who retains the house. In 2012 ownership was transferred to Rod and Sue Grieves who are now reside there with their family. The building has been altered over its life with rear sections removed and replaced. Internally, many changes have been made including extending the kitchen area both into the space of the verandah and into an extension of the house.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nDescription\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nIlfracombe is a large one-storeyed timber constructed overlooking, to the east, a reach of the Mary River. Access to the house is via a laneway from the northern end of Lennox Street, with the building concealed from the street. Surrounding the house is a large garden which includes several established trees and plantings._NEWLINE_The house is a timber framed building clad with horizontal timber weatherboards. The corrugated iron roof of the building, which incorporates an attic, is quite complex, reflecting the complexity of the internal planning. The roof scape comprises a number of asymmetrically arranged and variously sized gabled and hipped sections, with a steeply pitched mansard roof over the attic, which is surmounted with a decorative cast iron balustrade, with projecting finials from the corners. Surmounting the gabled ends are similar cast iron finials. The house is lined on three sides by bull-nosed verandahs although some of these have been infilled._NEWLINE_Generally the building has high quality joinery and craftsmanship; several projecting bay windows are filled with etched and coloured glass panels and the external joinery is of fine quality._NEWLINE_Internally the building generally has timber boarded floors, walls and ceilings. Occasionally the size or orientation of timber boarding varies indicating that much of the house may have been papered or otherwise lined internally when constructed. The interior is arranged around a central vestibule from which hallways lead to the principal entrance to the south and to the kitchen on the west. Many original features remain intact, including a fine anaglypta lined vaulted ceiling in the drawing room; internal doors and other joinery; a fine fireplace with painted tiles, despite many internal alterations.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nHeritage listing\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nIlfracombe was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria._NEWLINE_The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland\\'s history._NEWLINE_Ilfracombe was constructed between 1893 and 1895 as the residence Margaret Blair, who was the sister-in-law of Andrew Heron Wilson on whose land the house was built, adjacent to his own residence.

Set in the post-apocalyptic wasteland of the former Russian Federation, the player must cope with the new hazards and engage in combat against mutated creatures as well as hostile humans. The player wields an arsenal of hand-made weaponry which can be customised through scavenging materials and a crafting system. The game features a mixture of linear levels and sandbox environments. It also includes a dynamic weather system, a day-night cycle, and environments that change along with the seasons as the story progresses. It is set over the course of one whole in-game year.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nSetting\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nMetro Exodus is set after the events of Metro: Last Light, on a post-apocalyptic Earth that has been devastated by a nuclear war. The game continues the story from Metro: Last Light\\'s \"Redemption\" ending. Similar to the previous two entries, the player assumes the role of Artyom, who flees the Moscow Metro and sets off on a continent-spanning journey with his allies to the far east, on a locomotive called the \"Aurora\". The story takes place over the course of one year, starting with a harsh nuclear winter in the Metro. Another major character, returning from the previous game and the book Metro 2035, is Anna - who is now Artyom\\'s wife. Miller, Anna\\'s father and leader of the Spartan Order, also returns from previous games and novels.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nPlot\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nAfter the attack on D6, Artyom becomes disillusioned with the constant infighting and corruption within the Metro and leaves the Spartan Order. He soon becomes obsessed with proving that other human survivors exist outside of Moscow and makes numerous dangerous expeditions to the surface, much to Anna\\'s concern and Miller\\'s frustration. However, on one such expedition with Anna, they witness a working train running on the surface. Before they can follow it, they are captured by Hansa soldiers along with a couple of people who claim to be from outside of Moscow. The Hansa soldiers execute the other prisoners and Artyom is shot and left for dead. Surviving the gunshot, Artyom follows the soldiers to their base to rescue Anna, and in the process inadvertently destroys a signal jammer that was blocking all communications going in and out of Moscow. Radio transmissions from all over the world begin to be picked up, and Artyom and Anna realise humanity has not gone extinct. They escape by stealing one of Hansa\\'s trains with the aid of a defected Hansa train engineer called Yermak._NEWLINE_As the train leaves, the Spartan Order moves in to retake it and are shocked and confused at Artyom and Anna\\'s presence. Knowing that Hansa will have all of them put to death for knowing the truth, Miller concludes that the Spartans\\' best chance of survival is to flee Moscow. Once outside the city, he reveals to the others that while many of Russia\\'s cities were bombed, the war did not end and NATO proceeded to occupy what was left of the nation. To prevent more bombs from being dropped on Moscow, the Russian leadership decided to secretly jam all communications to make the outside world believe nobody had survived. They then receive a radio broadcast from Moscow Defense Command calling for survivors to rally at the \"Ark\" located at Mount Yamantau and Miller decides to head there, believing that the Ark is where the Russian government has rebuilt itself._NEWLINE_After crossing the cult-controlled Volga River, the Spartans reach the Yamantau base and discover that the base\\'s service crew have devolved into cannibals luring survivors in with the false promise of safety. Artyom and the Spartans manage to fight their way out and escape, but Miller\\'s faith in Russia is shattered when he discovers that the government never took refuge in Yamantau, or even survived the war, and thus the Spartans are left wondering what to do next. Using a map they recovered from Yamantau, they decide to travel to a satellite communication center near the Caspian Sea in the hopes of gaining access to a satellite to find habitable land to settle. At the dried up remains of the Caspian Sea, the Spartans steal water and fuel from the local bandits while obtaining an updated satellite map._NEWLINE_As the Spartans continue on their journey, Anna begins to cough up blood, fearing the cause was accidentally breathing poison gas during the journey. They decide to scout a nearby taiga forest valley to see if it is suitable to settle. While scouting the forest, Artyom is caught between two rival survivor factions, and he discovers that the dam protecting the valley from radiation is on the verge of failing, making the area uninhabitable. Artyom returns to the train to learn Anna\\'s condition has worsened. The only chance to save Anna is to find the antidote in Novosibirsk, but the entire city is heavily irradiated._NEWLINE_Miller and Artyom decide to head into the city alone to search for the antidote despite the risk. They enter the Novosibirsk Metro and find a young boy named Kiril, one of the last of the Novosibirsk survivors. Kiril explains that his father left on a mission to obtain a map marking the location of a clean, habitable area. Miller decides to go find the map while Artyom heads out to find the antidote. He manages to recover the antidote, but is gravely wounded by a mutant and absorbs a heavy dose of radiation. Artyom, Miller, and Kiril return to the train with the map and the antidote, but Miller dies of radiation poisoning on the way back after using a dose of anti-radiation serum meant for himself to save Artyom. The rest of the Spartans donate their own blood to give Artyom a critical blood transfusion. Anna is cured with the antidote and with the map, the Spartans settle on the shores of Lake Baikal, which is completely free from radiation._NEWLINE_Artyom\\'s ultimate fate depends on the choices the player made during the journey. In the bad ending, Artyom dies from the radiation poisoning, and the Spartans and a grieving Anna hold a funeral for him and Miller while Artyom\\'s spirit awakens on a dilapidated version of the Aurora. Artyom, along with the spirit of Miller and other characters, remain in this ghostly purgatory for eternity. In the good ending, Artyom survives. Miller is buried and Artyom is selected to take his place as leader of the Spartan Order. Now that they have a home, Artyom decides to return to Moscow and reveal the truth of the world to the survivors of the Metro.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nDevelopment and release\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nMetro Exodus is developed by 4A Games.

Because of his father\\'s failed business, he had to drop out of primary school to work when he was 11 years old. When he was 18, after a near-fatal accident working at the Yokohama docks, he moved to Tokyo and became an apprentice in a gold lacquer workshop. Around this time he became interested in comic haiku. He joined a poetry society and started writing comic haiku under the pseudonym \"Kijiro\"._NEWLINE_In 1914, with The Tale of Enoshima, he won first prize in a novel-writing contest sponsored by the publisher Kodansha. He joined the newspaper Maiyu Shimbun in 1921, and in the following year he began publishing serializations, starting with Life of Shinran._NEWLINE_He married Yasu Akazawa in 1923, the year of the Great Kant\\xc5\\x8d earthquake. His experiences in the earthquake strengthened his resolve to make writing his career. In the following years he published stories in various periodicals published by Kodansha, who recognized him as their number one author. He used 19 pen names before settling on Eiji Yoshikawa. He first used this pen name with the serialization of Sword Trouble, Woman Trouble. His name became a household word after Secret Record of Naruto was serialized in the Osaka Mainichi Shimbun; from then on his writing became much more popular._NEWLINE_In the early 1930s, his writing became introspective, reflecting growing troubles in his personal life. But in 1935, with the serialization of Musashi, about famed swordsman Miyamoto Musashi, in the Asahi Shimbun, his writing settled firmly into the genre of historical adventure fiction._NEWLINE_Upon the outbreak of war with China in 1937 the Asahi Shimbun sent him into the field as a special correspondent. At this time he divorced Yasu Akazawa and married Fumiko Ikedo. During the war he continued writing novels, and became more influenced by Chinese culture. Among the works of this period are Taiko and his re-telling of the Romance of the Three Kingdoms._NEWLINE_At the end of the war he stopped writing for a while and settled down to enjoy a quiet retirement in Yoshino (present-day Oumeshi) on the outskirts of Tokyo, but by 1947 he had started writing again. His post-war works include New Tale of the Heike, published in the Asahi Weekly (1950), and A Private Record of the Pacific War (1958)._NEWLINE_On September 7, 1962, he died from cancer-related complications.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nEnglish translations\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nFour of his books have been translated into English.

Tracks were laid southwards from Whitehaven and Moor Row as far as Egremont by the Whitehaven, Cleator and Egremont Railway, opening to passengers on 1 July 1857. By the 1860s the company sought to extend southwards from Egremont to meet the coastal line at Sellafield, aiming for Millom, Barrow-in-Furness and beyond. The Furness opposed this, but the two companies came to an accommodation and built the Egremont to Sellafield extension as a joint line._NEWLINE_St Thomas Cross Platform was a Twentieth Century addition to the line. A service from Moor Row to Beckermet Mines, calling at Woodend, Egremont and St Thomas Cross was started on 15 January 1912, though it is possible that other workmen\\'s services called before then, as Florence Mine was nearby. _NEWLINE_The use of the term \"Platform\" usually signified that a station was an unstaffed halt. The halt must have been closed by 1933, when the structure was demolished. It was used by workers at the nearby Florence mine, which went on to be the last operating iron ore mine, as opposed to quarry, in Western Europe.

Walworth\\n_START_SECTION_\\nEarly life and education\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nReuben Walworth was the third son of merchant and American Revolutionary War quartermaster Benjamin Walworth (1746-1812), who after that war (in 1782) had married the widow Apphia (Hyde Cardell) Walworth (1757-1837). Reuben Walworth was born in Bozrah, New London County, Connecticut (his mother\\'s hometown) in 1788, and named to honor a maternal uncle. In 1792 Reuben Walworth received a land grant for his wartime service and moved his family moved to Hoosick, Rensselaer County, New York, where he operated a mill. They had eleven children; most of their sons became associated with the New York state courts. His eldest, John Walsworth (1784-1839) rose the rank of Major during the Revolutionary War and moved to Clinton County, New York where he served many years as clerk of the court before in 1829 moving to New York City and serving as Assistant Registrar of the Court of Chancery. Their second son, James Clinton Walworth (1787-1871), would become a merchant in Argyle, New York before becoming a judge in Otsego County, New York and serving for decades. The fourth son, Dr. Benjamin Walworth (1792 - 1879), became a leading citizen of Fredonia and for decades served as judge in Chautauqua County, New York._NEWLINE_Educated in the local schools, Reuben Walworth began teaching school when he was 16 (1804-5). He then began reading law in Troy, the Rensselaer county seat, under the guidance of John Russel. Princeton University would award him an honorary LL.D. degree in 1835, Yale University in 1839 and Harvard University in 1848.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nCareer\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nAdmitted to the New York bar in 1809, in January, 1810 Walworth moved to Plattsburgh, the Clinton County county seat and where his eldest brother Major John Walsworth served as clerk of the court. In 1811 Reuben Walworth was appointed a master of chancery, one of the local judges and whose particular responsibilities included overseeing and protecting widows and orphans, as well as issuing injunctions against nuisances._NEWLINE_During the War of 1812, Walworth served as adjutant-general of the New York militia, and as aide to General Benjamin Mooers. In September 1814, the British invaded Plattsburg, and Walworth from shore of Lake Champlain observed the naval victory of Commandant Thomas Macdonough in the Battle of Lake Champlain. He attained the rank  of colonel and headed the division\\'s judge advocate general corps by the war\\'s end. His youngest brother Hiram Walworth (1799-1870) distinguished himself in the battle for the Saranac bridge in that war, and would later become a lawyer and serve for many years under their brother John in New York City. A midshipman in that battle, Charles Theodore Platt, would later become his brother-in-law. Their father also died in 1812, killed by one of his horses; his mother would survive another 25 years, cared for by family in upstate New York._NEWLINE_Voters elected Walworth as a Democratic-Republican to the 17th United States Congress. Serving alongside fellow Democratic-Republican Nathaniel Pitcher (a future New York governor) in what was then New York\\'s 12th congressional district from December 3, 1821, to March 3, 1823, Walworth did not seek re-election in what became a one-representative district after census-based redistricting._NEWLINE_During his Congressional term, in April 1823, Walworth was appointed Judge of the New York Fourth Circuit Court. In October he moved to Saratoga Springs, Saratoga County, New York. Five years later, in 1828, Walworth was appointed Chancellor of New York, and continued to conduct court in his parlor. He remained in office until July 1847 when the State Constitution of 1846 abolished the office. Walworth wrote Rules and Orders of the New York Court of Chancery (Albany, 1829; several revised eds.), which greatly influenced equity practice in the United States._NEWLINE_Walworth gained President John Tyler\\'s attention because of his widely respected opinions on evidence, pleadings, civil procedure, and arbitration. Tyler nominated him to the Supreme Court of the United States three times in 1844, but the nomination was always postponed due to Tyler\\'s lack of support from both Whigs and the Democrats._NEWLINE_In 1848, Walworth was the Hunkers\\' candidate for Governor of New York, but was defeated in a three-way race by Whig Hamilton Fish._NEWLINE_In 1850, the United States Supreme Court appointed Walworth to serve as a commissioner (now special master) in litigation concerning the new Wheeling Suspension Bridge, the first bridge to cross a major river west of the Appalachian Mountains. The justices had divided during the previous years concerning the scope of the federal power in the Commerce Clause as well as concurrent state powers. In 1847, in U.S. v. New Bedford Bridge Company Justice Levi Woodbury on circuit duty had determined that no federal law defined obstruction of navigable waterways and upheld a drawbridge near the port, and Justice Samuel Nelson had done similarly while a justice of the New York Supreme Court. The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania (through its attorney general Cornelius Darragh) and Pittsburgh interests represented by Edwin M. Stanton and Robert J. Walker had brought this litigation in the United States Supreme Court by seeking an injunction against the bridge from the justice responsible for that geographic area, former Pennsylvania judge for the Pittsburgh area, Robert C. Grier. The Wheeling Bridge Company was represented by Charles W. Russell and U.S. Attorney general Reverdy Johnson (supposedly in a private capacity but who had denied Pennsylvania\\'s request for his federal office\\'s assistance)), among others. They argued the bridge helped the U.S. mails (delayed during ice and high and low water periods), connected military outposts, and that the public had a right to cross the river. Crucial to the equity required for the sought-after injunction, they argued, Pennsylvania had delayed two years while the bridge was under construction, as well as failed to prove irremediable injury (because technology also existed to lower steamboat smokestacks, as was necessary to use a downriver canal near Louisville, Kentucky. After Justice Grier held a hearing in Philadelphia on August 16, 1849, on August 30 he refused the requested injunction to remove the bridge. Instead, he referred the matter to the full court. That heard argument on February 25, 1850, reviewed extensive depositions (361 printed pages) and then on May 29, 1850, Justice Nelson (over a dissent by Justice Peter V. Daniel who would have refused jurisdiction altogether) issued a one-page order appointing Walworth as commissioner._NEWLINE_Walworth received much scientific and commercial evidence, including a report from U.S. Army engineer William Jarvis McAlpine. However, both parties were dissatisfied with Walworth\\'s 770 page report, which he issued in December 1851. Pittsburgh was disappointed that Walworth refused to order the bridge removed. Virginia and Ohio interests complained because he found the waterway obstructed and recommended raising the bridge an additional 20 feet\\xe2\\x80\\x94which would cause enormous technical difficulties and additional cost. However, after reviewing both parties\\' exceptions, receiving another report from McAlpine and hearing more argument on February 23 and 24, the U.S. Supreme Court also refused to order the bridge removed, but instead amended the new required height to 111 feet. However, the bridge then disintegrated during an May 1854 windstorm and was rebuilt in eight weeks despite an injunction against such by Justice Grier (hence the 1856 litigation).  Nonetheless, Walworth\\'s report undergirded the Court\\'s decisions in both 1852 as well as 1856 (the latter decision also relying on additional federal legislation). Completion of the B&O Railroad to Wheeling, and competition from a new steamboat line connection Wheeling with Louisville proved fatal to both steamboat companies, who soon dismantled their ships or sold them downriver for the Mississippi trade. Furthermore, additional bridges across the Ohio River were proposed for Parkersburg, Bellaire and Steubenville. A truss pivot drawbridge across the Mississippi River between Davenport, Iowa and Rock Island, Illinois was completed in 1856._NEWLINE_Returning to private legal practice, Walworth grew wealthy representing railroads in other litigation. He expanded the family mansion._NEWLINE_As the American Civil War neared, Walworth advocated peace and conciliation. A delegate at the Peace Conference of 1861] after the election of President Abraham Lincoln, his speech was published and circulated. As discussed below, his son Mansfield Walworth failed to receive a deferment from conscription during the American Civil War and was imprisoned for three month in 1864 as a suspected Confederate spy until released and restricted to the Saratoga Springs vicinity. However, his stepson Martin Davis Hardin (1837-1892), a West Point graduate, remained in the Union Army, distinguished himself in battle, and was promoted to General.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nPersonal life\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nWalworth married twice. On January 16, 1812, Reuben Walworth married Maria Ketchum Averill (1795\\xe2\\x80\\x931847). They had four daughters and two sons. Both sons initially became lawyers and then writers, but also created widely different scandals of their era, as discussed below. After mourning Maria\\'s death for four years, Walworth in Harrodsburg, Mercer County, Kentucky in 1851 married Sarah Ellen (Smith) Hardin, widow of Congressman John J. Hardin (1810\\xe2\\x80\\x931847) who had died in the Mexican American War and whose daughter Ellen Hardin  was then 19. Walsworth\\'s eldest son, Clarence A. Walworth (1820\\xe2\\x80\\x931900) was admitted to the New York bar in 1841, and after studies at the General Theological Seminary in New York, converted from the Protestant Episcopal Church to Catholicism, a scandal in the era of the Know Nothing party. Rev. Walworth became a missionary within the United States, and his brother and wife were among those he converted to Catholicism. He also published books about his new faith as well as history (including his family), and became one of the five founders of the Paulist Fathers. His temperamental brother, Mansfield Tracy Walworth (1830\\xe2\\x80\\x931873), after graduation from Harvard Law School became a novelist. In 1852 he married his stepsister, and had several children. Mansfield Walworth never completed the legal history his father wanted, but instead wrote lurid novels, and was ultimately disinherited by his father in favor of his wife/step-sister and progeny. During the American Civil War, he failed to receive a deferment from conscription, but secured a staff position in 1863, only to be imprisoned for three months in Capitol Prison as a suspected Confederate spy in 1864, before being released on orders of Gen. Fremont but restricted to the Saratoga Springs vicinity. To his father\\'s dismay, Mansfield Walworth regularly abused his wife. In 1873 their son Francis Hardin \"Frank\" Walworth (1853-1883), invited his father to a New York City hotel room, then shot him four times, killing him. The trial caused a sensation, his lawyers arguing for acquittal by reason of insanity and the judge allowed Mansfield\\'s abusive letters to his wife into evidence. Convicted of a lesser charge, his mother secured his release in 1877._NEWLINE_A devout Presbyterian, Walworth became an elder and known for charity toward the poor. A Freemason, he rose to Grand Master in the Grand Lodge of New York in 1853. He was also vice-president of the Bible Society and the Tract Society, and for a long period president of the American Temperance Union. Walworth also wrote Hyde Genealogy (2 vols., 1864), and was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1865.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nDeath and legacy\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nWalworth died in Saratoga Springs on November 28, 1867, survived by his wife, children and several grandchildren. He is buried at Greenridge Cemetery in Saratoga Springs._NEWLINE_Walworth County, Wisconsin and Walworth, New York were named for him. His stepdaughter inherited the family mansion, Pine Grove, which the Chancellor had expanded to 55 rooms (including a courtroom). It survived a century, but was torn down after his granddaughter died, Saratoga Springs having become a racing and gambling center. Several rooms are recreated in the Saratoga Springs History Museum.

Before milk bottles were available, milkmen took churns on their rounds and filled the customers' jugs by dipping a measure into the churn. The near-ubiquity of refrigerators in homes in the developed world, as well as improved packaging, has decreased the need for frequent milk delivery over the past half-century and made the trade shrink in many localities sometimes to just three days a week and disappear totally in others. Additionally, milk delivery incurs a small cost on the price of dairy products that is increasingly difficult to justify and leaves delivered milk in a position where it is vulnerable to theft._NEWLINE_Milk deliveries frequently occur in the morning and it is not uncommon for milkmen and milkwomen to deliver products other than milk such as eggs, cream, cheese, butter, yogurt, or soft drinks._NEWLINE_In some areas, apartments and houses would have small milk-delivery doors.

Mrazovi\\xc4\\x87 is known in literary annals as a Serbian education reformer who lived and worked in the Habsburg Empire in Serb and Romanian territories of today\\'s Serbian Vojvodina and Romanian Banat at the same time as Teodor Jankovi\\xc4\\x87 Mirijevski and Stefan Vujanovski. He is the first director of the Serb National Primary School Commission after being named to the post by his mentor, Teodor Jankovi\\xc4\\x87-Mirijevski. He also founded Norma (Normal school), a teacher training college in Sombor in 1778 before another school was opened in 1812 in Szentendre called Regium Pedagogium Nationis Illiricae (Preparandium in Latin or Preparadija in Serbian) which eventually was relocated back to Sombor in 1816. Mrazovi\\xc4\\x87 wrote and published Rukovodstvo k slavenstej grammatice: vo upotreblenik slaveno-serbskih narodnyh ucilisc (a Serbian grammar with correct syntax) in Vienna in 1794 for Serbian schools. He credited Meletius Smotrytsky\\'s 1619 work as his inspiration. _NEWLINE_The first book on logic in the Serbian language was written by Nikola Simi\\xc4\\x87, Avram Mrazovi\\xc4\\x87\\'s friend, and was published in Budapest in two volumes, entitled \"Logic\"  (Vol. I, 1808; Vol. II, 1809). Ten years later, Mrazovi\\xc4\\x87 wrote the second book on logic in Serbian in a similar manner, entitled \"Logic, or Reasoning\", completed in 1826, the year he died. The book was not published. _NEWLINE_Aside from Pavle Julinac, remembered as the first to translate from French, other translators of the period were Gligorije Trlaji\\xc4\\x87, Nikola Lazarevi\\xc4\\x87, Atanasije Stojkovi\\xc4\\x87, and Avram Mrazovi\\xc4\\x87.

Also inside the maze are three enemy creatures similar to that of the player. The object of the game is to eliminate the enemy creatures before one of them eliminates the player. When all three enemies are defeated, the player advances to the next maze._NEWLINE_The enemy creatures appear in one of three colors: red, yellow or green. Red creatures are longer in length than the player, and as such a collision with the creature will cost the player one life. Yellow creatures are the same length as the player, thus posing no harm upon a collision. Green creatures are shorter than the player, and will be devoured by the player's creature if they collide. The player can shoot at the creatures, with each hit reducing the number of segments by one. As segments are removed, the creatures are able to move faster, thus making them harder to catch and eliminate._NEWLINE_Points are scored for shooting the creatures, as well as for collecting pieces of fruit that appear in the maze at random locations. These fruits will also add an extra segment to the player's creature.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nPorts\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nThe only contemporary home system ports of Jungler were by Emerson for the Tomy Tutor in 1981 and also for Emerson's Arcadia 2001 console in 1982.

In seek of adventure, she answers a help wanted in the newspaper and goes slumming as a domestic servant in a boarding house. She makes ludicrous efforts to cook, serve food, and clean, how ever the men living in the boarding house are enamored with her beauty and charm enough to overlook her incompetence. Among the boarders is a tall handsome violinist (David Miles), whose kindness and musical talent stand out among the crass manners of the other men. Helen and the violinist's romance inspires jealousy among the other maid, who conspire to get rid of Helen by framing her for the theft of the musician's violin. Although the violinist believes Helen is innocent, she is still fired and sent away. Helen soon reveals her true identity and reunites with the musician. After their reunion, Helen secures the violinist a position as a director at a conservatory.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nProduction\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nAs was the case with most of the films Griffith made during this period, most of the film's props and costumes were recycled from other productions.

His initial education came from Rauna Parish School where he also learned to play the organ. From the age of sixteen he worked as a private tutor; later he was a teacher at Valmiera Parish School and an organist.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nEducation\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nIn 1836 Cimze went to Germany to study at Weissenfels Teachers\\' Seminary which he finished in 1838. This was where he learned to play the violin and piano and improved his skills as an organist. In 1838\\xe2\\x80\\x9439 he was an external student at Berlin University where he attended lectures on mathematics, didactics and the theory of music. His music professor was Ludwig Christian Erk, a collector, harmoniser, publisher and researcher of German folk songs.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nVidzeme Teachers\\' Seminary\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nUpon returning from Germany, from 1839 and to the end of his life, Cimze headed Vidzeme Teachers\\' Seminary where he taught future teachers the conducting of choirs and harmonisation of folk songs. Cimze followed the principles of Johann Pestalozzi and Adolph Diesterweg and all education was conducted in German._NEWLINE_During his forty-two years of work at the Teachers\\' Seminary Cimze educated more than four hundred students who subsequently became Latvian and Estonian teachers. Being a teacher in the 19th century meant being also an educator, a musician, a literary and public figure. In the second half of the 19th century teachers organised choirs and worked with them and cultural societies.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nMusical legacy\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nJ\\xc4\\x81nis Cimze promoted the development of Latvian choral singing and the cultivation of a cappella performance. His collection of songs for choirs \"Dziesmu rota\" (A Garland of Songs) was published in eight parts in 1872\\xe2\\x80\\x9484. This first ever professional collection of songs for choirs in Latvia formed the foundation of Latvian choir culture. Parts II (1872), III (1874), IV (1875) and VII (1884) of \"Dziesmu rota\", which go under the title of \"Lauku pu\\xc4\\xb7es\" (Wild Flowers), are the first collections of Latvian folk songs arrangements and represent a number of folk song genres: songs of seasons and family customs, work songs, farewell songs of recruits and conscripts, songs of orphans as well as songs for games and lullabies._NEWLINE_J\\xc4\\x81nis Cimze was the first prominent Latvian figure in music, whose example inspired extensive collection, publishing, arrangement and research of folk music. It fostered the development of the choir-singing movement and the creation of new original compositions. Thanks to the activities of Cimze and his students, the first All-Estonian (1869) and All-Latvian (1873) Song Festivals were held. Cimze was among those who conceived the idea of the event, while his student and associate Indri\\xc4\\xb7is Z\\xc4\\xable was one of the chief conductors at the Song Festival. The programme of the Song Festival included several arrangements of folk songs by Cimze and his brother D\\xc4\\x81vid. Cimze\\'s German sentiments surfaced as he compared the three brothers making the dowry-chest for their sister in the song \"R\\xc4\\xabga dimd\" (Riga resounds) to the German nobility, the Lutheran Church and the German Riga. For this he was severely criticised by Atis Kronvalds.'</td>\n",

That is, if G contains an edge (u,v) then the converse/transpose/reverse of G contains an edge (v,u) and vice versa.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nNotation\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nThe name converse arises because the reversal of arrows corresponds to taking the converse of an implication in logic. The name transpose is because the adjacency matrix of the transpose directed graph is the transpose of the adjacency matrix of the original directed graph.  _NEWLINE_There is no general agreement on preferred terminology._NEWLINE_The converse is denoted symbolically as G', G\\xe1\\xb5\\x80, G\\xe1\\xb4\\xbf, or other notations, depending on which terminology is used and which book or article is the source for the notation.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nApplications\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nAlthough there is little difference mathematically between a graph and its transpose, the difference may be larger in computer science, depending on how a given graph is represented. For instance, for the web graph, it is easy to determine the outgoing links of a vertex, but hard to determine the incoming links, while in the reversal of this graph the opposite is true. In graph algorithms, therefore, it may sometimes be useful to construct the reversal of a graph, in order to put the graph into a form which is more suitable for the operations being performed on it. An example of this is Kosaraju's algorithm for strongly connected components, which applies depth first search twice, once to the given graph and a second time to its reversal.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nRelated concepts\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nA skew-symmetric graph is a graph that is isomorphic to its own transpose graph, via a special kind of isomorphism that pairs up all of the vertices._NEWLINE_The converse relation of a binary relation is the relation that reverses the ordering of each pair of related objects. If the relation is interpreted as a directed graph, this is the same thing as the transpose of the graph. In particular, the order dual of a partial order can be interpreted in this way as the transposition of a transitively-closed directed acyclic graph.\"</td>\n",

On 1 September 1894, London\\'s Metropolitan Railway (MR) reached Aylesbury, and shortly afterwards connected to the A&BR line, with local MR services running to Verney Junction from 1 April 1894. Through trains from the MR\\'s London terminus at Baker Street began on 1 January 1897._NEWLINE_Richard Temple-Nugent-Brydges-Chandos-Grenville, 3rd Duke of Buckingham and Chandos, had long had an interest in railways, and had served as chairman of the London and North Western Railway from 1852 until 1861. In the early 1870s he decided to build a light railway to transport freight from his estates in Buckinghamshire to the A&BR\\'s line at Quainton Road._NEWLINE_The first stage of the route, known as the Wotton Tramway, was a 4-mile (6.4\\xc2\\xa0km) line from Quainton Road via Wotton to a coal siding at Kingswood, and opened on 1 April 1871. Intended for use by horse trams, the line was built with longitudinal sleepers, to avoid horses tripping.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nExtension to Brill\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nLobbying from the nearby town of Brill for the introduction of passenger services on the line led to an extension from Wotton to a new terminus at the foot of Brill Hill, north of the hilltop town of Brill itself, in March 1872. Two mixed trains each day ran in each direction. With the extension to Brill opened the line was renamed the Brill Tramway. The Duke bought two Aveling and Porter traction engines modified to work as locomotives, each with a top speed of 8 miles per hour (13\\xc2\\xa0km/h), although a speed limit of 5 miles per hour (8\\xc2\\xa0km/h) was enforced._NEWLINE_The Duke died in 1889. In 1894, the trustees of his estate set up the Oxford & Aylesbury Tramroad Company (O&ATC) with the intention of extending the line from Brill to Oxford, but the extension beyond Brill was never built. The MR leased the Brill Tramway from 1 December 1899, although the line continued to be owned by the O&ATC.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nServices and facilities\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nBrill was a small town of 1,400 people when the line opened, and owing to the town\\'s hilltop setting the station was \\xe2\\x80\\x8b\\xc2\\xb3\\xe2\\x81\\x84\\xe2\\x82\\x84 of a mile (1.2\\xc2\\xa0km) from Brill itself. Brill railway station was small, with a single low platform. At its opening there was one station building, which served as the freight depot, passenger terminal, and ticket office. Next to it was a siding that led to a cattle pen. Two cottages for station staff were built near the station in 1871. A third cottage across the road from the station was built in 1885, possibly to serve as an office. After the 1899 transfer of services to the Metropolitan Railway, the MR introduced a single Brown Marshall passenger carriage on the line; at this time, a small wooden hut was added to the station to serve as a ticket office and waiting room and a short section of platform was raised to conventional height to allow access to the higher doors on the new carriage.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nPassenger services\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nFrom 1872 to 1894 the station was served by two passenger trains per day, and from 1895 to 1899 the number was increased to three per day. Following the 1899 transfer of services to the Metropolitan Railway, the station was served by four trains per day until its closure in 1935. Limited by poor-quality locomotives and ungraded, cheaply laid track which followed the contours of the hills, and with five intermediate stops to pick up and set down goods, passengers and livestock, trains ran very slowly; in 1887 trains needed 1\\xc2\\xa0hour\\xc2\\xa045\\xc2\\xa0minutes to travel the six miles from Brill to the junction station at Quainton Road. Improvements to the line carried out at the time of the transfer to the Oxford & Aylesbury Tramroad, and the use of the MR\\'s better-quality rolling stock, reduced the journey time from Brill to Quainton Road to between 32 and 36 minutes._NEWLINE_Serving a lightly populated area, and with trains travelling only marginally quicker than walking pace, Brill station saw relatively little use by passengers; in 1932, the last year of private operation, Brill station (and the nearby halt at Wood Siding) saw only 3,272 passenger journeys and raised only \\xc2\\xa3191 (about \\xc2\\xa313,000 in 2019) in passenger receipts.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nGoods facilities\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nAlthough little-used by passengers, Brill station was valuable as a relatively rapid link between the dairy farms of Buckinghamshire and the markets of Aylesbury and London; around 30 carts per day would deliver milk to Brill station for the first train each morning. There was also a small amount of coal traffic to the station; Brill coal dealer George Green received three coal wagons per month. In addition, a storehouse at the station held beer supplied by the breweries of Brackley and Aylesbury. Bricks and tiles from the brick and tile factories of Brill were used in the construction of Waddesdon Manor, near the eastern end of the Brill Tramway, between 1874 and 1889._NEWLINE_In 1885 the Duke of Buckingham opened a modern brickworks near Brill station, with a dedicated siding, and in 1895 his heir William Temple-Gore-Langton, 4th Earl Temple of Stowe, expanded the brickworks, which became the Brill Brick & Tile Works, using the Brill Tramway to deliver bricks to the main line at Quainton Road. With the connection to Oxford and the upgrading of the rail line abandoned, Brill Brick & Tile Works was unable to compete with the nearby brickworks at Calvert, and soon closed. The building was taken over by the Fenemore workshop, making hay loaders, before being converted into a timber yard in the 1920s.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nClosure\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nOn 1 July 1933 the Metropolitan Railway, along with London\\'s other underground railways except for the small Waterloo & City Railway, was taken into public ownership as part of the newly formed London Passenger Transport Board (LPTB). Thus, despite it being 45 miles (72\\xc2\\xa0km) and over two hours\\' travel from the City of London, Brill station became a terminus of the London Underground network. Frank Pick, Managing Director of the Underground Group from 1928 and the Chief Executive of the LPTB, aimed to move the network away from freight services, and saw the lines beyond Aylesbury via Quainton Road to Brill and Verney Junction as having little future as financially viable passenger routes, concluding that over \\xc2\\xa32,000 (about \\xc2\\xa3140,000 in 2019) would be saved by closing the Brill Tramway. As a consequence, the LPTB decided to withdraw all passenger services beyond Aylesbury. The Brill Tramway was closed on 1 December 1935; the last services ran on 30 November._NEWLINE_Upon the withdrawal of London Transport services the lease expired, and the railway and stations reverted to the Oxford & Aylesbury Tramroad Company. With no funds and no rolling stock of its own, the O&ATC was unable to operate the line, and on 2 April 1936 the entire infrastructure of the line was sold at auction. The former goods shed at Brill sold for \\xc2\\xa37\\xc2\\xa010s (about \\xc2\\xa31,170 in 2019), and a railway-owned house attached to Brill station fetched \\xc2\\xa3350 (about \\xc2\\xa323,400 in 2019). All buildings in Brill associated with the railway station have been demolished, with the exception of the station cottages, one of which is now called \"Sleepers\". The station site is now largely open fields, and the site of the brickworks is a light industrial park known as the \"Tramway Business Park\".'</td>\n",

Non-payment of debts\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nConcerning the eighteen titles of law, the non-payment of debt is almost always listed first. According to Davis this is because, \"A very old practice of textual organization within Dharma\\xc5\\x9b\\xc4\\x81stra and other textual genres of Sanskrit calls the first procedure or topic to be described the archetype (prakrti) and the subsequent procedures or topics the ectypes (vikrti). We saw this practice in the placement of the Brahmin as the archetype as a matter of textual concision. The Non-payment of Debts is the archetype for the other titles of law, not only because its description overlaps with and in some respects encompasses the contents of the other titles but also because debt as its thematic content pervades the subsequent titles. In terms of overlap, questions about witness, autonomy, competence, documentation, and contractual securities are all assumed in and carry over to discussions of the later titles.\"\\n_START_SECTION_\\nii. Deposits\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nThe Sanskrit word for deposits is Nik\\xc8\\x99epa, the words upanidhi and ny\\xc4\\x81sa are synonyms. Manu VIII 179 holds that deposits should be entrusted to those who have good dharma. The person who holds the deposit typically does not receive any person benefit from doing so. The misappropriation or misplacement of a deposit due to negligence is regarded as very sinful. \"The idea is that no one is bound to accept a deposit, but when a person accepts it, his primary duty is to preserve it with care and the next duty is to return it at the time agreed or on demand. The obligation arises from the trust reposed in a person.\"\\n_START_SECTION_\\niii. Sale without ownership\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nDatt\\xc4\\x81prad\\xc3\\xa4nika is concerned with the resumption of a gift. The N\\xc4\\x81rada-Sm\\xe1\\xb9\\x9bti \"defines it as that title where a man desires to resume what has been given by him because it has been improperly given by him\". In the History of the Dharma\\xc5\\x9b\\xc4\\x81stras Vol. III, P.V. Kane states, \"According to the N\\xc4\\x81rada-Sm\\xe1\\xb9\\x9bti VII. 1 and the Sm\\xe1\\xb9\\x9bti of B\\xe1\\xb9\\x9bhaspati  when a person, who holds an open deposit, a sealed deposit, an article bailed for delivery to another, stolen property, an article borrowed for some festival, a pledge, or property lost by a stranger and found (by him), sells it in secret (or behind the back of the owner) it is to be considered as a sale by one who is not the rightful owner.\"  That which may be given must be absolutely one\\'s own with the exception of things that are required for the maintenance of one\\'s family.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nTypes of sale without ownership\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nA sale by a non-owner is known as asv\\xc4\\x81mi-vikraya. There are two different types of sales without ownership: pratipanna-asv\\xc4\\x81mi-vikrayah and apratipanna-asv\\xc4\\x81mi vikrayah. The first, pratipanna-asv\\xc4\\x81mi-vikrayah, occurs when the unauthorized possessor admits to being a non-owner. The second, apratipanna-asv\\xc4\\x81mi vikrayah occurs when the possessor does not admit to being a non-owner. The first types of sale is resolved without dispute because the possessor returns the possession to the rightful owner. The second type of sale results in a case because the possessor, although not the true owner, has sold, given, or pledged the property to a third party. In the case of the second type of sale \"the entire process of the court has to be gone through with both parties leading evidence to buttress their respective claims, and the court then giving its judgement.\"  It is seen as important that there is a first category of sale without ownership because it hints at the how \"the state was involved in the settlement of people\\'s disputes at an informal level.\"\\n_START_SECTION_\\nLiability of an innocent buyer\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nAn innocent buyer is regarded as one who does not know that what he has purchased was sold by someone without ownership. _NEWLINE_\\xc5\\x9aambhu, who heavily relies on Manu and Mar\\xc4\\xabci, holds that \"a buyer who makes his purchase from the open market, and in the full knowledge of king\\'s men will get a clear title to the goods so purchased irrespective of the bona fides of the seller.\"  Deva\\xc5\\x86a refutes this and goes so far as to say that \"not even a hundred citations of rules can confer ownership rights upon the buyer who buys from a non-owner. Deva\\xc5\\x86a agrees with \\xc5\\x9aambhu only insofar as the true owner fails to identify his property.\\n_START_SECTION_\\niv. Partnerships\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nPartnerships in Hindu law are any venture that results in two or more people working together. The \\xc5\\x9b\\xc4\\x81stras have a lot to say about the different kinds of partnerships, whom one should enter into a partnership with, and rules for governing partnerships with respect to profits, losses, and quarrels among partners. For example, the Sm\\xe1\\xb9\\x9bti of B\\xe1\\xb9\\x9bhaspati states regarding potential partners, \"that a man should carry on a joint business with other persons of good family, that are clever, active, intelligent (or educated), familiar with cons, skilled in controlling (expenditure) and income, honest and valiant (or enterprising) and that joint undertakings like trade should not be carried on by prudent men with persons (partners) who are weak or lazy or afflicted with disease or are unlucky or destitute (of money).\"  Kane states, \"It is interesting to note that the ancient Dharmasutras of Gautama, \\xc4\\x80pastamba and Baudh\\xc4\\x81yana are silent about partnerships, and that Manu  lay down rules about the distribution of fees among the priests at a sacrifice ad that in one verse  he remarks that the same principles are to be applied in all matters where men work conjointly.\"\\n_START_SECTION_\\nv. Delivery and non-delivery of gifts\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nNon-delivery or resumption of gift is referred to as \"dattanapakarma\" in the sm\\xe1\\xb9\\x9btis. The N\\xc4\\x81rada-Sm\\xe1\\xb9\\x9bti divides the title into four categories, \"what may be given, what may not be given, what are valid gifts, and what are invalid gifts.\" The Sm\\xe1\\xb9\\x9bti of K\\xc4\\x81ty\\xc4\\x81na as reconstructed by P.V. Kane, is useful in elaborating and giving insight to this title of law. It states regarding invalid gifts, \"These cannot be given either because they are not one\\'s absolute property or because the gift of them is forbidden by the sages. In the case of even those who hold that one has ownership over one\\'s son or wife, the gift of them is not possible because it is forbidden, just as though one owns rice, yavas and masa beans, one cannot make offerings of masa because the veda prohibits their use.\"\\n_START_SECTION_\\nvi. Non-payment of wages\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nVetana-Anap\\xc4\\x81karma is the Sanskrit word for the non payment of wages. The early sm\\xc5\\x97tis concern themselves in large part with the payment of wages to workers. The B\\xc5\\x97haspati is popularly cited by many medieval authors asserting that \"a worker shall not do even the slightest mischief to the master; if he does he loses his wages and proceedings (v\\xc4\\x81da) begin.\" Mathur contends that \"Deva\\xc5\\x86a has made it clear that this verse has reference to proceedings in a court. He says that when a worker is defeated he loses his wages in proportion to the damage caused to his master.\"  Deva\\xc5\\x86a switches the order in which litigation and losing wages occurs.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nvii. Breach of contract\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nThe law of contracts is hugely concerned with the contract of debt, of pledge or mortgage, of bailments, of sale, of partnership, and of hire and service. The law of contracts is not found in one place. The dharma\\xc5\\x9b\\xc4\\x81stras do not lay down a general code of rules applicable to all transfers of immovable property, nor do they treat of transfers by way of sale, mortgage or gift in separate sections.\"  _NEWLINE_Ancient writers largely commented on who was competent to enter into transactions. Those who are \"dependent, minors, extremely old, charged with grave sins, devoid of a limb, and those that are addicted to vices\" are considered incompetent and agreements with these people are invalid. Kau\\xc8\\x9bilya holds that any contract made under the influence of intoxicants or wrath are invalid as well as those made when a person is distressed or has an unsound mind. Manu reinforces this by stating that all contracts entered into by force are invalid. Contracts that are contrary to the kings orders are regarded as invalid. According to Deva\\xc5\\x86a the king has the power to outlaw any agreements that are against \\xc5\\x9bruti and sm\\xc5\\x97ti or tainted by greed.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nviii. Cancellation of a sale or purchase\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nThe Manusm\\xe1\\xb9\\x9bti deals with the cancellation of a sale or purchase. \"The principle rule is that the buyer or the seller may rescind the deal within ten days if he feels dissatisfied. But anyone forcing the other party to rescind it shall be punished.\" _NEWLINE_The Mit\\xc4\\x81k\\xc8\\x99ar\\xc4\\x81 identifies the liability of the seller in case of a cancellation of a sale by the seller dependent on whether there is a price difference in a product. \"When the price goes down the seller will have to compensate the buyer as prescribed by N\\xc4\\x81rada; where the price rises, and the buyer is likely to earn an extra profit, the liability of the seller is not extinguished, and he has to pay the buyer the value of the benefit, or the usufruct as the case may be. However, if the price remains unchanged the seller still has to pay interest at the rate of five percent per annum on the amount paid by the buyer.\"\\n_START_SECTION_\\nix. Disputes between owners and herdsman\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nIn ancient times India was a predominately agricultural society and therefore Sv\\xc4\\x81mip\\xc4\\x81laviv\\xc4\\x81da was a major basis of litigation. Sv\\xc4\\x81mip\\xc4\\x81laviv\\xc4\\x81da is the Sanskrit word that refers to the disputes between the owner of cattle and the herdsman who tends to them. According to P.V. Kane \"during the day the responsibility for the safety of the cattle rests on the herdsman and during the night on the owner provided they are in the latter\\'s house.\" _NEWLINE_The herdsman is liable for cattle if he does not attempt to save them or if he neglects them. Kane also states that \"it is the duty of the cowherd to struggle as much as in him lies to protect the cows from accidents and if he is unable to do so he must quickly inform the owner.\"  If a herdsman does not struggle to save the or protect the animals he is responsible for making good the value of the animals lost and for paying a fine of 12 \\xc2\\xbd panas to the king. The herdsman is also responsible if the animal dies or is lost by theft. However, if after the theft of an animal the herdsman immediately notifies the owner he is not responsible. The herdsman\\'s responsibility is also voided if he is seized, the village is attacked, or the country is invaded.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nx. Boundary disputes\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nBoundary disputes are called \"ksetrajaviv\\xc4\\x81da\", or disputes relating to fields. In the Dharma\\xc5\\x9b\\xc4\\x81stras the section titled Sima Vivadah deals with the determination of boundaries of fields, homes and villages. The N\\xc4\\x81radasm\\xe1\\xb9\\x9bti defines boundary disputes as, \"dispute with regard to land in which questions about dikes or embankments, the boundaries of fields, ploughed land and fallow land.\". There are six causes of boundary dispute in most of the sastras, and the Sm\\xe1\\xb9\\x9bti of K\\xc4\\x81ty\\xc4\\x81na states them as: \"claiming more land, claim that a person is entitled to less than he possesses, claim to a share, denial of a share, seizing possession when previously there was none, and boundary.\"\\n_START_SECTION_\\nxi. Verbal assault\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nP.V. Kane states, \"V\\xc4\\x81kp\\xc4\\x81rusya, da\\xe1\\xb9\\x87\\xe1\\xb8\\x8dap\\xc4\\x81rusya, steya, strisangrahana, and sah\\xc4\\x81sa are five titles out of 18 that are concerned with what may be called criminal matters or crimes in modern nomenclature.\" They represent, respectively, abuse and defamation, assault, theft, adultery or unlawful intercourse with a woman, and violence._NEWLINE_The N\\xc4\\x81radasm\\xe1\\xb9\\x9bti says v\\xc4\\x81kp\\xc4\\x81rusya is defined as, \"abusive words that loudly proclaim censure of another\\'s country, caste, family and the like and that cause mental pain or offence to that man.\" The N\\xc4\\x81radasm\\xe1\\xb9\\x9bti further defines three kinds of defamation, \"ni\\xe1\\xb9\\xa3\\xe1\\xb9\\xadhura (reproachful such as calling a man a fool or a rogue), a\\xc5\\x9bl\\xc4\\xabla (obscene or insulting), and t\\xc4\\xabvra (mercilessly severe such as charging a man with such grave sins as brahm\\xc4\\x81na-murder or drinking liquor) and that each punishment for each later one is more severe that for each preceding one.\"\\n_START_SECTION_\\nxii. Physical assault\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nTo define Da\\xe1\\xb9\\x87\\xe1\\xb8\\x8dap\\xc4\\x81rusya, or assault, the Kau\\xe1\\xb9\\xadilya\\'s Artha\\xc5\\x9b\\xc4\\x81stra begins by saying assault, \"comprises touching, threatening to strike and actually striking another.\" Going slightly further, \"The N\\xc4\\x81rada-Sm\\xe1\\xb9\\x9bti XVIII. 4\\xe2\\x80\\x936 defines it as injuring the limbs of another with the hand, foot, weapon or other means (such as stones) or defiling or causing pain by (bringing) ashes and similar substances in contact with another\\xe2\\x80\\xa6assault may be one of three kinds viz. mild, middling and highly punishable.\"  It is even explained in the Y\\xc4\\x81j\\xc3\\xb1avalkyasm\\xe1\\xb9\\x9bti that causing injury to animals and trees would fall under this category. Manu contends that the punishment should be commensurate with that of the harm caused to the victim.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nxiii. Theft\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nTheft, or streya, is defined by the Kau\\xe1\\xb9\\xadilya\\'s Artha\\xc5\\x9b\\xc4\\x81stra as \"depriving a man of his wealth either clandestinely or openly and either by night or by day.\"  The N\\xc4\\x81rada-Sm\\xe1\\xb9\\x9bti defines theft as, \"derivation of wealth by various means from people that are asleep, careless or intoxicated.\" Like assault, there are varying degrees of theft depending on what was stolen. The three kinds are: \"trifling (when earthen-ware, seats, cots, wood, hides, grass, beans in pods or cooked food is stolen), middling (when the theft relates to clothes except silken ones, animals except cows and bulls, metals except gold, rice and barley), and grave or high (when gold jewels, silken cloth, women, men, cattle, elephants, horses, and the wealth of br\\xc4\\x81hmanas or temples is stolen).\" There are several texts that agree on the definition of a thief including the Manu-Sm\\xe1\\xb9\\x9bti, N\\xc4\\x81rada-Sm\\xe1\\xb9\\x9bti, and the Sm\\xe1\\xb9\\x9bti of B\\xe1\\xb9\\x9bhaspati. Their definition contends that, \"thieves are traders who employ false weights and balances, gamblers, quacks, bribers of sabhyas, prostitutes, those who profess to arbitrate, those who manufacture imitation articles, those who subsist by prognosticating good fortune or portents or by magic or palmistry, false witnesses, etc.\"\\n_START_SECTION_\\nxv. Sexual crimes against women\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nVas. 28. 2-3 states that, \"when a woman is polluted by being raped or kidnapped by a thief, she should not be abandoned; one should wait till her monthly illness (making her undergo certain expiations till then) and she becomes pure after it.\"  The Matsyapur\\xc4\\x81\\xc5\\x86a liberally states that a woman who is raped is innocent while a man who commits rape should be put to death. Other texts are harsher, such as those of the late sm\\xc5\\x97ti writer Devala, that states that women who are raped and conceive may not be restored to social intercourse even after undergoing expiation.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nxvii. Partition of inheritance\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nThe \\xc4\\x80pastamba principle holds that after the death of one property owner the other is entitled to the property. After the death of a husband a wife succeeds all of the husband\\'s estate without allotting any shares for their sons. Upon the death of both parents sons are to divide ancestral estate and paternal debt equally. Partitioning during a mother\\'s lifetime is only allowed with the mother\\'s consent. \"Traces of this rule are to be found even in IX-104 of the Manu Smrti which can be literally rendered as: brothers may take equally the ancestral wealth after the mother and the father; they have no competence so long as the mother and the father are alive\"\\n_START_SECTION_\\nxviii. Gambling and betting\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nDy\\xc5\\xa9ta sam\\xc4\\x81hvaya, known as \\'gambling and betting games,\\' is a traditional title of dispute first present in the earlier sm\\xc5\\x97tis with little change in the post sm\\xc5\\x97ti period. The Mit\\xc4\\x81ksar\\xc4\\x81 is one of the only texts that presents a change, defining gambling as \"any transaction involving betting with stake money\" thus expanding the definition beyond games like dice and cockfighting. _NEWLINE_ According to Mathur, Manu\\'s categorical command to the kings to completely prohibit all gambling influences many texts like the Vyavah\\xc4\\x81ra Nir\\xc5\\x86aya and the Sm\\xc5\\x97ti Candrik\\xc4\\x81. These texts reflect no desirability in having any law allowing gambling. However, there are other texts like the B\\xc5\\x97haspati that find gambling law to be beneficial for purposes of taxation and to provide ease in the search for criminals.'</td>\n",

He composed the opera in less than four months, May to September 1813 but had difficulties with count Palffy that interfered with getting it staged in Vienna. Though he took the manuscript score privately to Giacomo Meyerbeer, who played it, with Spohr singing\\xe2\\x80\\x94 supplementing his vocal range by whistling\\xe2\\x80\\x94 it was not until Carl Maria von Weber took an interest in the score that it received its premiere. Weber conducted the first performance of Faust at the St\\xc3\\xa4ndetheater, Prague on 1 September 1816. Meyerbeer introduced it at Berlin._NEWLINE_In its original form, the opera was a Singspiel in two acts. In 1851, Spohr turned the piece into a grand opera in three acts, replacing the spoken dialogue with recitative. This version (in an Italian translation) received its premiere at the Royal Italian Opera, Covent Garden, London on 15 July 1852. A performance was given by the University College Opera at the Bloomsbury Theatre in February 1984. In 1993 the Bielefeld Opera also performed this form of Faust in what was claimed to be the first staged production worldwide since 1931. Conducted by Geoffrey Moull and directed by Matthias Oldag, the opera was given 8 performances and subsequently recorded for CPO.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nSynopsis\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nFaust is torn between his love for the young R\\xc3\\xb6schen and his desire for Kunigunde, the fianc\\xc3\\xa9e of Count Hugo. He makes a pact with the devil Mefistofeles which allows him to rescue Kunigunde from the clutches of the evil knight Gulf. Faust obtains a love potion from the witch Sycorax which he gives to Kunigunde during her wedding celebrations. Outraged at the sudden passion his bride shows for Faust, Count Hugo challenges him to a duel. Faust kills Hugo and flees. Meanwhile, Faust's first love, R\\xc3\\xb6schen, drowns herself in despair. Mefistofeles seizes Faust and drags him down to Hell.\"</td>\n",

However, some advanced racers will use EGT gauges in combination with a wideband oxygen sensor to 'lean' the fuel ratio a bit to safely raise the temperature for more power.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nAdvanced tuning\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nThough by tuning primarily by EGT and air fuel ratio values, EGT is still to this day a used data output for engine tuning. When fine tuning an engine, if possible with the ECU manipulation with the cylinder's timing can be made. By adjusting the timing, the resultant cylinder temperature can be used to improve cylinder efficiency. Though this is still widely done, EGT values should be used as a safe guard sensor measure and as a tuning guide. [1]\"</td>\n",

It is located in the Central Volcanic Zone and is part of the Paleocene-Eocene volcanic belt. The caldera is located 50 kilometres (31\\xc2\\xa0mi) southwest of Copiapo.  It is heavily eroded. Active during the Cretaceous, it is a large caldera. Post-collapse activity generated subsidiary calderas inside the older main caldera.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nGeology\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nThe caldera has dimensions of 58 by 32 kilometres (36\\xc2\\xa0mi \\xc3\\x97\\xc2\\xa020\\xc2\\xa0mi) with a north-northeast axis. The caldera has a surface area of 1,400 square kilometres (540\\xc2\\xa0sq\\xc2\\xa0mi), bounded by the Quebrada San Miguel to the north and Lomas Bayas in the south. Two fault zones \\xe2\\x80\\x94 La Ternera and San Antonio \\xe2\\x80\\x94 cut the caldera. Inside the caldera 3,000 metres (9,800\\xc2\\xa0ft) thick layers of lava, pyroclastic flows and sediments. A pluton, Cabeza de Vaca, lies in the southern and eastern sectors of the caldera and has dimensions of 52 by 1\\xe2\\x80\\x937 kilometres (32.31\\xc2\\xa0mi \\xc3\\x97\\xc2\\xa00.62\\xc2\\xa0mi\\xe2\\x80\\x934.35\\xc2\\xa0mi). Within the caldera several smaller calderas formed, from north to south Caldera Cerro Puquios, Caldera Bellavista, Caldera Agua Nueva, Caldera El Durazno and Caldera Lomas Bayas. The Puquios caldera partly overlaps the Carrizalillo caldera margin. These subsidiary calderas have left lava conduits, lacustrine and intrusive structures and other geomorphologic features. The caldera is constructed in the terrain of the San Antonio formation, which forms megabreccia in the caldera.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nSubsidiary calderas\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nThe Lomas Bayas caldera (diameter 13 kilometres (8.1\\xc2\\xa0mi)) cuts into the pre-main caldera basement. 400 metres (1,300\\xc2\\xa0ft) of pumice and breccia lie in the caldera and 80 metres (260\\xc2\\xa0ft) of lacustrine deposits. 150 metres (490\\xc2\\xa0ft) thick pyroclastic flows from Caldera Durazno entered the Lomas Bayas caldera. The Caldera Durazno is a 12 kilometres (7.5\\xc2\\xa0mi) wide semicircle that is filled by eruption-associated pyroclastics and postcaldera lava flows. The Caldera Agua Nueva lies northeast of Durazno and is filled with a 50 metres (160\\xc2\\xa0ft) thick post-Carrizalillo ignimbrites. The Bellavista caldera is similar to the other calderas and also forms an arc with a diameter of 12 kilometres (7.5\\xc2\\xa0mi). Trachyandesitic banks lie on its western margin, and in the caldera lies a deposit of welded pumice 600 metres (2,000\\xc2\\xa0ft) thick. It contains lithic fragments including monzonite, likely formed from blocks sagging into the caldera.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nEruption history\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nThe Hornitos basin is the precursor of the caldera, and the Lavas de Sierra La Dichosa form a precaldera stage. During the Cretaceous-Paleocene a group of stratovolcanoes formed in the area. Their eruption products are basalt and trachybasalt containing olivine and pyroxene. Magmatic intrusion triggered the formation of ring faults which then allowed the eruption of pyroclastic flows during caldera collapse. After the collapse, dacitic lava flows in the central sector of the caldera form the first postcollapse volcanism. Reestablishment of the volcanic system was strong enough to form another sequence, 1,100 metres (3,600\\xc2\\xa0ft) thick, of pumice and pyroclastics, possibly the consequence of another caldera collapse. The Cabeza de Vaca pluton formed within the caldera, using the western caldera rim and the annular fracture. Activity occurred in the Paleocene-Eocene, with the pluton dated 63-59.8 mya. The subsidiary calderas are dated 48-56 mya.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nPetrology\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nRhyolitic pyroclastic flows were erupted during the caldera collapse. They contain devitrified fiammes and lack lithic fragments. The lack of fragments and the overall homogeneity indicates that the deposits were placed in short succession. Postcaldera flows are dacites which that are derived from the deeper portions of the magma chamber. Cabeza de Vaca contains granodiorite, granite and monzonite as well as tourmaline breccias containing Cu-Au minerals. The Lomas Bayas-El Durazno mining district is associated with the caldera.'</td>\n",

Edward Marsden (1869-1932) was a Canadian-American missionary and member of the Tsimshian nation who became the first Alaska Native to be ordained in the ministry.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nEarly life\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nHe was born May 19, 1869, in Metlakatla, British Columbia, and became from his earliest years a prot\\xc3\\xa9g\\xc3\\xa9 of that utopian Christian community\\'s founder, the charismatic Anglican lay minister William Duncan.  Edward\\'s father, Samuel Marsden, had been one of Duncan\\'s first converts and was named after a famed Anglican missionary.  Edward\\'s mother was Catherine Kitlahn, Duncan\\'s housekeeper.  Duncan tutored young Edward in reading, music, and eventually bookkeeping and business.  As a teenager, Marsden was one of the approximately 800 Tsimshians who undertook an epic canoe voyage in 1887 to found Duncan\\'s new, dissident community of \"New Metlakatla\" on Annette Island in the very southeast of Alaska._NEWLINE_Duncan exercised fierce control over his parishioners\\' lives and for a while barred the young, ambitious Marsden from leaving the island to pursue higher education.  Eventually, the Presbyterian missionary Sheldon Jackson intervened and persuaded Duncan to let Marsden join him in Sitka, Alaska, to attend the industrial school there (now known as Sheldon Jackson College)._NEWLINE_There he became Jackson\\'s own prot\\xc3\\xa9g\\xc3\\xa9, earning high marks, learning to preach, and gradually shifting from Duncan\\'s low-church Anglicanism towards conversion to Presbyterianism._NEWLINE_Jackson arranged for Marsden to attend the Carlisle Indian School in Pennsylvania and then Marietta College in Ohio, making him the first Alaska Native to receive higher education in the \"lower 48.\"  During his education there, he joined the Presbyterian Church, deepening his schism with Duncan. In 1894 he became a U.S. citizen, the first Alaska Native to do so. He attended Lane Theological Seminary in Cincinnati, Ohio, from which he graduated in 1898, becoming ordained the same year. Also, in 1897 he became the first North American Indian to be licensed to preach in the U.S.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nCareer\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nDuncan refused to find a position for Marsden in Metlakatla, and was especially opposed to Marsden\\'s suggestion that a Presbyterian church be established on Annette Island to minister to the Tlingit families on the island. The island was (and is) still the unceded territory of the Tongass tribe of Tlingit, who were then, as now, a predominantly Presbyterian people._NEWLINE_Instead, under Jackson\\'s direction, Marsden was installed as minister at the Tlingit community of Saxman, near Ketchikan. The establishment of that mission consolidated that community\\'s position as a gathering place for various Tlingit subgroups of the area.  From here he participated in a fierce rivalry with Duncan for Tsimshian loyalties, including participating in a campaign to have Duncan removed by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA).  His complaints, and those of many in the community, focused on Duncan\\'s control over the community\\'s entire economic life and his opposition to his flock\\'s seeking any economic or educational betterment off of the island._NEWLINE_Marsden married Lucy Kinninook, the young woman whose job was to translate Marsden\\'s English sermons into Tlingit. She was a Tlingit chief\\'s daughter and had been partially raised by the missionary Thomas Crosby in the Tsimshian community of Lax Kw\\'alaams (a.k.a. Port Simpson), B.C. Duncan refused to perform their marriage on the grounds that she was a divorc\\xc3\\xa9e._NEWLINE_Marsden was also involved in the short-lived sawmill community of Port Gravina, near Ketchikan, which was founded in 1892 and burned to the ground in 1904. This was an offshoot of the Metlakatla community, committed to Presbyterianism rather than Anglicanism and oriented to individual economic advancement outside of Duncan\\'s control._NEWLINE_After Duncan\\'s death in 1918, Marsden was involved in the transition to new leadership, becoming a partner in running the Metlakatla Commercial Company, the community\\'s economic engine._NEWLINE_In 1922, Marsden began construction of a Presbyterian church in Metlakatla, where he was to serve as minister until his death.  He was also a political leader in the community.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nDeath\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nIn May 1932 Marsden died in Ketchikan of injuries sustained during a rough sea voyage between Metlakatla and Hydaburg, Alaska.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nLegacy\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nA comparison of two accounts\\xe2\\x80\\x94a 1955 biography of Marsden by William Gilbert Beattie, a Presbyterian BIA superintendent who had been allied with him, and on the other hand Peter Murray\\'s very pro-Duncan account of the controversies in his 1985 Duncan biography (see bibliography) -- will attest to the strong feelings that the Duncan-Marsden rivalry continue to give rise to among those with a stake in the Metlakatla community.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nArchival Collections\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nThe Presbyterian Historical Society in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, has a single letter written by Edward Marsden.

He also submitted that in the guise of classy uniforms and pretension of culture superiority, men are turned into monsters, saying \"Noblemen, while largely withheld to a point of minimalism, bursts sporadically with an unsettling energy as it explores the circumstances in which monsters create more monsters.\" Roger Walker-Dack concurred with Adlakha, and said, \"The Noblemen brings home the point that in such an insidious regime where bullying still persists it is a breeding ground for even more homophobia.\" Sreeparna Sengupta of The Times of India gives the film three stars out of five, praising performance of Ali Haji, Muskaan Jaferi, Hardik Thakkar, Mohommad Ali Mir, Shaan, Kunal Kapoor and Soni Razdan, she says, \"Winter and the backdrop of mountains, makes for the perfect setting in Noblemen as an unpredictable twist and the end of innocence makes its way here.\" She opines that Noblemen deals with school bullying and presents a graphic picture of its brutality and psychological impact it leaves on the mind of victim. She feels that the film lags pace here and there but it brings to fore some important issues. Amman Khurana of Times Now rated it three stars out of five, said, \"Noblemen, engaging for the most part, is not your regular masala entertainer. [So] prepare yourself for an in-your-face cinematic experience.\" He felt that performances of ensemble were \\'top-notch\\'.

Roosevelt in Executive Order 9139 of April 18, 1942. Its chairman was Paul V. McNutt, head of the Federal Security Agency. In this Executive Order, the War Manpower Commission was headed by the Federal Security Administrator as Chairman, and consisted of representatives from the Department of War, the Department of the Navy, the Department of Agriculture, the Department of Labor, the War Production Board, the Labor Production Division of the War Production Board, the Selective Service System, and the United States Civil Service Commission to ensure effective mobilization of manpower in the post-war era._NEWLINE_Executive Order 9279, dated December 5, 1942, transferred the Selective Service System to the War Manpower Commission. However, a year later it was made a separate agency directly responsible to the President._NEWLINE_McNutt appointed all men to his labor advisory committee, despite the pleas of Women\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Bureau director, Mary Anderson, to have women represented. Instead, he created a Women\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Advisory Committee appointing thirteen prominent women professionals, business executives, journalists, educators and organizational presidents.

The integrity constraints in IC specify general properties of the problem domain that need to be respected in any solution of a problem._NEWLINE_A problem, G, which expresses either an observation that needs to be explained or a goal that is desired, is represented by a conjunction of positive and negative (NAF) literals. Such problems are solved by computing \"abductive explanations\" of G._NEWLINE_An abductive explanation of a problem G is a set of positive (and sometimes also negative) ground instances of the abducible predicates, such that, when these are added to the logic program P, the problem G and the integrity constraints IC both hold. Thus abductive explanations extend the logic program P by the addition of full or partial definitions of the abducible predicates. In this way, abductive explanations form solutions of the problem according to the description of the problem domain in P and IC. The extension or completion of the problem description given by the abductive explanations provides new information, hitherto not contained in the solution to the problem. Quality criteria to prefer one solution over another, often expressed via integrity constraints, can be applied to select specific abductive explanations of the problem G._NEWLINE_Computation in ALP combines the backwards reasoning of normal logic programming (to reduce problems to sub-problems) with a kind of integrity checking to show that the abductive explanations satisfy the integrity constraints._NEWLINE_The following two examples, written in simple structured English rather than in the strict syntax of ALP, illustrate the notion of abductive explanation in ALP and its relation to problem solving.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nExample 1\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nThe abductive logic program, , has in  the following sentences:_NEWLINE_  Grass is wet if it rained._NEWLINE__NEWLINE_  Grass is wet if the sprinkler was on._NEWLINE__NEWLINE_  The sun was shining._NEWLINE_The abducible predicates in  are \"it rained\" and \"the sprinkler was on\" and the only integrity constraint in  is:_NEWLINE_  false if it rained and the sun was shining._NEWLINE_The observation that the grass is wet has two potential explanations, \"it rained\" and \"the sprinkler was on\", which entail the observation. However, only the second potential explanation, \"the sprinkler was on\", satisfies the integrity constraint.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nExample 2\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nConsider the abductive logic program consisting of the following (simplified) clauses:_NEWLINE_  X is a citizen if X is born in the USA._NEWLINE__NEWLINE_  X is a citizen if X is born outside the USA and X is a resident of the USA and X is naturalized._NEWLINE__NEWLINE_  X is a citizen if X is born outside the USA and Y is the mother of X and Y is a citizen and X is registered._NEWLINE__NEWLINE_  Mary is the mother of John._NEWLINE__NEWLINE_  Mary is a citizen._NEWLINE_together with the five abducible predicates, \"is born in the USA\", \"is born outside the USA\", \"is a resident of the USA\", \"is naturalized\" and \"is registered\" and the integrity constraint:_NEWLINE_  false if John is a resident of the USA._NEWLINE_The goal \"John is citizen\" has two abductive solutions, one of which is \"John is born in the USA\", the other of which is \"John is born outside the USA\" and \"John is registered\". The potential solution of becoming a citizen by residence and naturalization fails because it violates the integrity constraint._NEWLINE_A more complex example that is also written in the more formal syntax of ALP is the following.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nImplementation and systems\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nMost of the implementations of ALP extend the SLD resolution-based computational model of logic programming. ALP can also be implemented by means of its link with Answer Set Programming (ASP), where the ASP systems can be employed. Examples of systems of the former approach are ACLP, A-system, CIFF, SCIFF, ABDUAL and ProLogICA.'</td>\n",

The tradition holds that there may be multiple Kukaraja\\'s which are conflated (a view also propounded by modern scholarship) or the different Kukkaraja according to Nyingma tradition may be understood as a lineage of mindstream emanations.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nInstruction\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nAccording to Nyingma tradition, King Ja taught himself intuitively from \"the Book\" of the Tantric Way of Secret Mantra (that is Mantrayana) that magically fell from the sky along with other sacred objects and relics \"upon the roof of King Ja\" according to Dudjom (1904\\xe2\\x80\\x931987), et al. (1991: p.\\xc2\\xa0613 History) took place on the Tibetan calendar year of the Earth Monkey, which Dudjom  et al. identify as 853 BC[E]. Kukuraja received instruction drawn from \"the Book\" on what may be understood as the Outer Tantras from King Ja, then King Ja received instruction on what may be understood as the Inner Tantras from Kukuraja (Kukkuraja taught King Ja after Kukkuraja received a direct revelation of Vajrasattva wherein Vajrasattva prophesied the imminent esoteric transmission of Vajrapani, the Lord of Secrets, to Kukuraja which was only made possible through the quickening of Kukuraja by King Ja with his intuitive knowledge drawn from \"the Book\") as Dudjom (1904\\xe2\\x80\\x931987), et al. (1991: p.\\xc2\\xa0460) of the principally Nyingma view relates:_NEWLINE_\"Then King Ja taught the book to master Uparaja, who was renowned as a great scholar throughout the land of Sahor, but he could not understand their symbolic conventions and meaning. The king then taught them to the master Kukkuraja. He intuitively understood the chapter on the \"Vision of Vajrasattva\", from the Tantra of the Magical Net of Vajrasattva [Wylie: rdo rje sems dpa\\' sgyu \\'phrul drva ba (also known as the Guhyagarbha Tantra)], and practiced it, whereupon Vajrasattva revealed himself and predicted that the Lord of Secrets would reveal the meanings of this tantra thereafter. When he had practised more, the Lord of Secrets actually appeared and granted him [Kukkuraja] the complete empowerment of the authentic teaching and of all vehicles. Then he told him to request the verbal teaching from the Licchavi Vimalakirti. It is said that, following the transmitted precepts of the Lord of Secrets, master Kukkuraja divided [the Mahayoga tantras] into the Eighteen Great Tantrapitaka (tantra chen-po sde bco-brgyad) and taught them to King Ja.\"\\n_START_SECTION_\\nInterpreter\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nKukuraja interpreted Tantras for King Indrabhuti.

This is important for identifying the date of the tantric lineage(s) that disseminated to the Indonesian archipelago, refer: Vajrayana Buddhism in Southeast Asia._NEWLINE_Candi Sukuh  is a fifteenth-century Javanese-Hindu-Buddhist temple (candi) that demonstrates strong tantric influence. Candi Sukuh is located on the western slope of Mount Lawu (elev. 910\\xc2\\xa0m or 3,000 feet (910\\xc2\\xa0m) above sea level) on the border between Central and East Java provinces. The monument was built around 1437, as written as a chronogram date on the western gate, meaning that the area was under the rule of the Majapahit Kingdom during its end (1293\\xe2\\x80\\x931500). The distinctive Dancing Ganesha relief in Candi Sukuh has a similarity with the Tantric ritual found in the history of Buddhism in Tibet written by Taranatha. The Tantric ritual is associated with several figures, one of whom is described as the \"King of Dogs\" (Sanskrit: Kukuraja), the mahasiddha who taught his disciples by day, and by night performed Ganacakra in a burial ground or charnel ground. Importantly, Ganesha also appears in Buddhism, not only in the form of the Buddhist god Vin\\xc4\\x81yaka, but also portrayed as a Hindu demon form also called Vin\\xc4\\x81yaka.  Ganesha\\'s image may be found on Buddhist sculptures of the late Gupta period.  As the Buddhist god Vin\\xc4\\x81yaka, Ganesha is often shown dancing, a form called N\\xe1\\xb9\\x9btta Ganapati that was popular in North India and adopted in Nepal and then into Tibet. It is this Dancing Ganesha form which is evident in Candi Sukuh. For more information on different permutations of Ganesha beyond \\'Hinduism\\' proper, refer Ganesha in world religions.'</td>\n",

In his early years, despite little formal education, he studied Shakespeare, Tennyson, Emerson and Lowell as well as works on spiritualism, Eastern religions, and metaphysics._NEWLINE_He met his future wife, Mary Caroline \"Myrtle\" Page, in Denison, Texas in the mid-1870s.  After losing his job there, he moved to Gunnison, Colorado where he worked at mining and real estate._NEWLINE_He married Myrtle in Clinton, Missouri on  March 29, 1881 and the newlyweds moved to Pueblo, Colorado, where Charles established a real estate business with the brother-in-law of Nona Lovell Brooks, who was later to found the Church of Divine Science.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nIntroduction to New Thought\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nAfter the births of their first two sons, Lowell Page Fillmore and Waldo Rickert Fillmore, the family moved to Kansas City, Missouri. Two years later, in 1886, Charles and Myrtle attended New Thought classes held by Dr. E. B. Weeks.  Myrtle subsequently recovered from chronic tuberculosis and attributed her recovery to her use of prayer and other methods learned in Weeks\\' classes. Subsequently, Charles began to heal from his childhood accident, a development which he too attributed to following this philosophy. Charles Fillmore became a devoted student of philosophy and religion._NEWLINE_In 1889, Charles  and Myrtle began publication of a new periodical, \\'Modern Thought\\', notable among other things as the first publication to accept for publication the writings of the then 27-year-old New Thought pioneer William Walker Atkinson.  In 1890, they announced a prayer group that would later be called \\'Silent Unity\\'. In 1891, Fillmore\\'s \\'Unity\\' magazine was first published. Dr. H. Emilie Cady published \\'Lessons in Truth\\' in the new magazine. This material later was compiled and published in a book by the same name, which served as a seminal work of the Unity Church. Although Charles had no intention of making Unity into a denomination, his students wanted a more organized group. He and his wife were among the first ordained Unity ministers in 1906. Charles and Myrtle Fillmore operated the Unity organizations from a campus near downtown Kansas City.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nDeath\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nMyrtle Fillmore died in 1931. Charles remarried in 1933 to Cora G. Dedrick who was a collaborator on his later writings.  Charles Fillmore died in 1948.  Unity continued, growing into a worldwide movement; Unity World Headquarters at Unity Village and Unity Worldwide Ministries are the organizations of the movement.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nTenets and Beliefs\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nIn a pamphlet called \"Answers to Your Questions About Unity\", poet James Dillet Freeman says that Charles and Myrtle both had health problems and turned to some new ideas which they believed helped to improve these problems.  Their beliefs are centered on two basic propositions: (1) God is good. (2) God is available; in fact, God is in you. The pamphlet goes on to say that:_NEWLINE_About a year after the Fillmores started the magazine Modern Thought, they had the inspiration that if God is what they thought - the principle of love and intelligence, the source of all good - God is wherever needed. It was not necessary for people to be in the same room with them in order for them to unite in thought and prayer._NEWLINE_In his later years, Fillmore felt so young that he thought that he might be physically immortal, as well as believing that he might be the reincarnation of Paul of Tarsus.

The institute hosts three scientific departments (with directors Moritz Helmstaedter of the Helmstaedter Department, Gilles Laurent of the Laurent Department, and Erin Schuman of the Schuman Department), the Singer Emeritus Group, two Max Planck Research Groups, namely Johannes Letzkus\\' Neocortical Circuits Group and Tatjana Tchumatchenko\\'s Theory of Neural Dynamics Group, as well as several additional research units. The common research goal of the Institute is a mechanistic understanding of neurons and synapses, of the structural and functional circuits which they form, of the computational rules which describe their operations, and ultimately, of their roles in driving perception and behavior. The experimental focus is on all scales required to achieve this understanding - from networks of molecules in dendritic compartments to networks of interacting brain areas. This includes interdisciplinary analyses at the molecular, cellular, multi-cellular, network and behavioral levels, often combined with theoretical approaches.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nHistory\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nThe \"Kaiser-Wilhelm-Institut f\\xc3\\xbcr Hirnforschung\" (KWI for Brain Research) was founded in Berlin in 1914, making it one of the oldest institutes of the \"Kaiser Wilhelm Society for the Advancement of Science\", itself founded in 1911. It was based on the Neurologische Zentralstation (Neurological Center), a private research institute established by Oskar Vogt in 1898 and run together with his wife C\\xc3\\xa9cile Vogt-Mugnier, also an accomplished brain researcher._NEWLINE_From 1901 to 1910, Vogt\\'s coworker at this institute was Korbinian Brodmann, who in 1909 established the cytoarchitectonic classification of cortical areas still in use today (e.g., his area 17 is the primary visual cortex). Oskar Vogt\\'s own scientific achievements also were in the field of cortical cytoarchitectonics and myeloarchitectonics._NEWLINE_In the 1920s Oskar Vogt became interested in the potential morphological correlates of mental abilities, and hence in the neuroanatomical study of \\'elite brains\\'. When Lenin died of a brain hemorrhage in 1924, his brain was preserved in formaldehyde, where it remained for two years. In 1926, Vogt was recruited by the Soviet government to help establish Lenin\\'s genius via histological investigation of his brain. He was given some space in Moscow to carry out this work and two years later, a spacious and representative brick building that had been confiscated from an American business. In it, he helped establish and then headed the Moscow Brain Institute. Between 1926 and 1930, Vogt travelled to Moscow several times to supervise the work on Lenin\\'s brain by the Russian collaborators who had been trained at Vogt\\'s KWI for Brain Research in Berlin._NEWLINE_In 1927, Vogt gave a preliminary report on his findings in Moscow, concluding from his histological observations that Lenin must have been an athlete in associative thinking (\"Assoziationsathlet\") - a conclusion deemed farfetched by some of his neurologist colleagues and adversaries. Lenin\\'s brain was, for a time, on display in the Lenin Mausoleum and now rests at Moscow\\'s Brain Institute._NEWLINE_World War I delayed the plans for a new building to house the KWI for Brain Research. The KWI\\'s first proper building in Berlin-Buch was only inaugurated in 1931 under the directorship of Oskar Vogt. It was the world\\'s largest and most modern brain research institute of its time, including Departments of Neurophysiology (T\\xc3\\xb6nnies and Kornm\\xc3\\xbcller), Neurochemistry (Marthe Vogt and Veit), Genetics (Timof\\xc3\\xa9eff-Ressovsky), a Research Clinic (Soeken, Zwirner), and the Neuroanatomical Departments of Oskar and his wife C\\xc3\\xa9cile Vogt. Based on critical remarks Vogt had made about national socialism, a protective attitude towards Jewish coworkers at the institute, and rumors that he was a communist (spirited by his Moscow contacts), Vogt was pressed to early retirement by 1937. The Vogts moved to Neustadt in the Black Forest and established another private brain research institute, funded in part by the family of steel baron Krupp (who had already funded Vogt\\xc2\\xb4s first private institute in Berlin) and by Vogt\\xc2\\xb4s own funds._NEWLINE_In 1937, Hugo Spatz, a pupil of Franz Nissl, became Vogt\\'s successor as director of the KWI for Brain Research and head of the Neuroanatomy Department. During his tenure, the Departments of Neuropathology (Hallervorden) and of Tumor Research (T\\xc3\\xb6nnis) were added. One focus of both Spatz\\xe2\\x80\\x99s and Hallervorden\\xe2\\x80\\x99s histological research were pathologies of the extrapyramidal/motor system. In a previous collaboration they had described an extrapyramidal disease that was later named Hallervorden-Spatz syndrome. _NEWLINE_Between 1940 and 1945, Hallervorden and Spatz became involved in the atrocities of the Nazi regime by studying the brains of euthanasia victims. For many years, brain sections from these studies remained archived in the institute (which by then had become the Max Planck Institute for Brain Research in Frankfurt am Main) together with research material from other periods. When this was recognized, all sections dating from the period 1933-1945 were given a burial at a Munich cemetery by the Max Planck Society in 1990. A memorial stone was erected in honor of the victims of these atrocities. Use of the eponym Hallervorden-Spatz syndrome is strongly discouraged due to Hallervorden and Spatz\\'s involvement with the Nazi party and was replaced by the more descriptive terminology pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration._NEWLINE_After 1945, the different departments of the KWI for Brain Research were relocated to Dillenburg, Giessen, K\\xc3\\xb6ln, Marburg and G\\xc3\\xb6ttingen. In 1948 the Max Planck Society was founded to succeed the Kaiser Wilhelm Society, and the institute became the Max Planck Institute for Brain Research. Hallervorden retired as director in 1955, Spatz in 1959. In 1962, a new building was erected in Frankfurt-Niederrad to house the Departments of Neurobiology (Hassler, Director 1959-1982) and Neuropathology (Kr\\xc3\\xbccke, Director 1956-1979), as well as the Research Groups \"Evolution of the Primate Brain\" (Stephan) and \"Neurochemistry\" (Werner). Rolf Hassler, a pupil of Oskar Vogt and coworker of the famous Freiburg neurologist Richard Jung, studied subcortical brain areas, thalamo-cortical systems, basal ganglia and the limbic system. Wilhelm Kr\\xc3\\xbccke, a pupil of Hallervorden, was a renowned specialist on peripheral neuropathies. He was the reason for the institute\\'s relocation to Frankfurt, as he was simultaneously head of the \\'Edinger Institute\\', the Neuropathology Department of Frankfurt University\\'s Medical School. In 1982, the KWI for Brain Research\\'s Department of General Neurology, which had been relocated to K\\xc3\\xb6ln, became the Max Planck Institute for Neurological Research in that city, independent of the MPI for Brain Research. The other relocated departments of the KWI were closed with the retirement of their directors._NEWLINE_In 1981, the MPIH was restructured towards non-clinical, basic neuroscience through the establishment of the Departments of Neuroanatomy (W\\xc3\\xa4ssle, Director 1981-2008) and Neurophysiology (Singer, Director 1982-2011), followed by the Department of Neurochemistry (Betz, Director 1991-2009). Heinz W\\xc3\\xa4ssle conducted functional and structural studies of the mammalian retina, Heinrich Betz analyzed the molecular components of synapses, and Wolf Singer studied higher cognitive functions with a focus on the visual system._NEWLINE_In the first decade of the new millennium, the MPG defined the analysis of neural networks as a central research topic for the institute. In 2008 Erin Schuman and Gilles Laurent were appointed as directors of the departments \"Synaptic Plasticity\" and \"Neural Systems\", respectively. The new departments took up work in the summer of 2009 and were initially located in interim facilities on the Science Campus \"Riedberg\" of the Frankfurt University. The construction of a new building for the institute on this campus was recently finalized, next to the MPI of Biophysics. The new institute building currently houses the three departments of the institute (those of Erin Schuman, Gilles Laurent and Moritz Helmstaedter), several Research Groups at the institute (Tatjana Tchumatchenko and Johannes Letzkus recently joined as Max Planck Group Leaders in 2013), several core facilities, and the Max Planck Research Unit for Neurogenetics of Peter Mombaerts._NEWLINE_As of 2016, Moritz Helmstaedter is the Managing Director of the Institute.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nGraduate Program\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nThe International Max Planck Research School (IMPRS) for Neural Circuits is a graduate program offering a Ph.D. The school is run in cooperation with the Max Planck Institute of Biophysics and the Johann Wolfgang Goethe University of Frankfurt am Main as well as the Frankfurt Institute for Advanced Studies and the Ernst Str\\xc3\\xbcngmann Institute.'</td>\n",

It was called St. Dominic Savio High School and served predominantly blue-collar Italian American and Irish American families in East Boston, Revere, Winthrop, and Chelsea._NEWLINE_Enrollment grew until the late 1970s, with peak at about 440 students. Those years saw a variety of new clubs and sports spring up. In 1970, alumnus, Paul Abbott, recalled a day when the student body voted on whether the school should add football or hockey as a new sport:_NEWLINE_\"It was 1970, the Bobby Orr era in Boston, so we chose hockey.\"_NEWLINE_In the 80s, the school suffered from decreasing enrollment and rising costs, partially due to an aging campus and shrinking pool of low-salaried Salesians, leading to increasing dependence on more expensive lay teachers._NEWLINE_At the end of the 1992-1993 school year, as part of a continual process to cut back on services due to a decrease in the number of priests and brothers, the Salesians announced that the school would be closing, a revelation that caused an uproar in the community.  The decline made it harder to keep up facilities, and an increase in costs in areas such as healthcare needed to take care of an aging priest population._NEWLINE_A group of alumnilead by Peter J Bagley, 75 stepped in and eventually the Salesians agreed to cede control of the school to the group, initially with no charge for property rental. In September 1993, St. Dominic Savio High was reincarnated as Savio Preparatory High School. Though there was no gap between the Salesians administering the school and the alumni taking over, the period of indecision that preceded the change saw many faculty members and students relocate to other schools.  Savio became coeducational in an effort to increase enrollment.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nNew direction\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nUnder the leadership of the Board and Fr. John Serio, S.D.B., from 1996-2002, Savio Prep\\'s enrollment grew to 400 students. In 2005, however, the athletic director, James Doherty plead guilty to charges of indecent assault and three counts of molesting female students.  Then, in 2006, the wrestling coach plead guilty to molesting two male students and hazing multiple others. These incidents caused enrollment to drop, and money to dry up. The building fell further into disrepair.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nSchool closed\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nAt the end of the 2006-2007 school year, the Salesian owners of the building did not renew the lease, citing the deterioration of the condition of the building and lack of funds to repair it. Concerned parents and alumni began meeting to discuss ways to keep the school open. The group called themselves \"Save Our Savio,\" but could never muster enough funding or support to find the school a new location.  It was clear that 2006-2007 had been the last St. Dominic Savio school year._NEWLINE_In 2008, it was revealed that the school administration rejected an offer to join the Christo Rey School Network, which would have saved the school financially._NEWLINE_The building now houses the Edward W. Brooke Charter School.  An addition has been built on the site of the former Salesian residence.'</td>\n",

FLOSS is an acronym for Free/Libre Open Source Software. The show was intended to be a weekly interview with the biggest names and influences in open source software. Episode one of FLOSS Weekly appeared on April 7, 2006._NEWLINE_Towards the end of 2006, episodes began to appear less frequently, dropping to a monthly basis. DiBona\\'s newborn baby and commitments at Google were cited as reasons for the show\\'s stagnation, and on the seventeenth episode, Laporte appealed for other co-hosts to share the burden. This was DiBona\\'s final appearance on the show as the host. He returned as a guest for the show\\'s 100th episode._NEWLINE_The show went on an unannounced three-month hiatus, re-appearing on July 21, 2007, with a new co-host, Randal Schwartz, who had previously appeared on the show as a guest. Schwartz has since taken over organizing guests for the show, and has restored the show to a predominantly weekly schedule (with occasional gaps from scheduling conflicts or last minute cancellations). Starting with episode 69, Jono Bacon was a somewhat regular co-host, even filling in for Randal when Randal wasn\\'t available._NEWLINE_The show was nominated for the 2009 Podcast Awards in the Technology/Science category._NEWLINE_In May 2010, the show began publishing a video feed (along with many of the rest of the TWiT network shows), and moved to an earlier recording time. As a result of the new recording time, Leo Laporte stepped down as the lead host, and Jono Bacon could no longer regularly co-host.  Randal Schwartz is supported by a rotating panel of co-hosts, selected on the basis of availability and appropriateness for the guest. The list includes  Guillermo Amaral, Gareth Greenaway, Dan Lynch, Aaron Newcomb, Jonathan Bennett and Simon Phipps and has previously included Joe Brockmeier and Randi Harper.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nFormat\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nMost episodes feature the primary developer or developers of a particular open source software project. The show is an open discussion, with the host and co-host asking questions about the nature of the project. Typically, the interviewers will ask the guests about the history of the project, and its development model (such as which language it is written in, which version control system is used, and what development environment the author uses). Some shows, such as the interviews with Jon \"maddog\" Hall and Simon Phipps, are not specific to an open source project, and feature more general topics, such as the philosophy of free and open-source software. Shows begin and end with a brief discussion between the hosts, before and after calling the guest. Often the guests are interviewed via Skype, with Laporte\\'s staff at TWiT being responsible for the audio recording and production. FLOSS Weekly has been supported by advertising and donations. In October 2006, FLOSS Weekly had 31,661 downloads of episode 14.'</td>\n",

She went on to attend Columbia University, where she received a master\\'s degree in parasitology in 1968, and a master\\'s degree in public health in 1969._NEWLINE_Although she was accepted to medical school, Buchanan decided not to go due to her desire to dedicate more time to her art. In 1971, she enrolled in a class taught by Norman Lewis at the Art Students League in New York City. Lewis, along with artist Romare Bearden, became friends and mentors to Buchanan. Buchanan decided to become a full-time artist in 1977 after exhibiting her work in a new talent show at Betty Parsons Gallery. In the same year, she moved to Macon, Georgia._NEWLINE_On July 4, 2015, Buchanan died in Ann Arbor, Michigan at the age of seventy-four.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nCareer\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nBuchanan has created drawings, sculpture, prints, video, and land art._NEWLINE_In 1976 and 1977, Buchanan drew \"black walls\" on paper. She \"wanted to see what the wall looked like on the other side\" and put four walls together in three dimensions. She then began to sculpt in cement. An example of a three-dimensional work from her early career is the sculpture \"Ruins and Rituals\" at the Museum of Arts and Sciences in Macon, Georgia, part of a series of concrete structures that recall ancient tombs._NEWLINE_Buchanan is best known for her many paintings and sculptures on the \"shack,\" a rudimentary dwelling associated with the poor. Scholar Janet\\xc2\\xa0T. Marquardt argues that Buchanan treats shacks not as documentary elements but as \"images of endurance and personal history\"; often using bright colors and a style of childlike simplicity, the works \"evoke the warmth and happiness that can be found even in the meanest dwelling, representing the faith and caring that is not reserved for privileged classes.\" Her art takes the form of stone pedestals, bric-a brac assemblages, funny poems, self portraits and sculptural shacks. But potent themes of identity, place and collective memory unite the works uncovering the animus that runs through them: to connect with those around her and reckon with the history that shaped her communities._NEWLINE_In 1981 Buchanan created Marsh Ruins, a temporal land art sculpture in coastal Georgia near a commentated site known as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Marshes of Glenn.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d To the east of the work was Saint Simons Island, where a group of Igbo people sold into slavery collectively drowned themselves in 1803. This work bears witness to the unmarked histories of enslaved peoples. There she planted three concrete forms and covered them with layers of tabby, a mixture used in slave living quarters. Marsh Ruins gradually disintegrated into the marsh. Buchanan captured that erosion process on video._NEWLINE_Buchanan said of her work, \"My work is a logical progression of my early interest in textures and surfaces and walls. The early \"walls\" were lonely, freestanding, fragmented things. When I lived in New York I was looking for things that were demolished. That gave them character. I liked to imagine who might have lived in the apartment, and whose home it might have been. Each family that moved in repainted the walls their color. When a building is torn down the various layers of color are exposed. It is almost surgical--like looking through a microscope and looking at different layers of tissue and media.\"_NEWLINE_In the fall of 2016 a comprehensive exhibition of her work opened at the Brooklyn Museum in the Elizabeth A. Sackler Center for Feminist Art. Beverly Buchanan - Ruins and Rituals featured painting, sculptures, drawings, as well as the artist\\'s notebooks and photographs form her personal archive._NEWLINE_Buchanan\\'s work was featured at the Independent Art Fair 2017 at Andrew Edlin Gallery\\'s booth. Buchanan has remarked, \"A lot of my pieces have the word \\xe2\\x80\\x98ruins\\xe2\\x80\\x99 in their titles because I think that tells you this object has been through a lot and survived \\xe2\\x80\\x94 that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the idea behind the sculptures \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s like, \\xe2\\x80\\x98Here I am; I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m still here!\\'\"_NEWLINE_Buchanan\\'s work is in the collection of the Addison Art Gallery of American Art at Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts, Georgia Museum of Art, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and the Whitney Museum of American Art.'</td>\n",

Although the wound was minor, Damiens' punishment for drawing royal blood was to be hanged, drawn and quartered._NEWLINE_At age 16, Gabrielle finds letters written by her father which prove that his crime had been instigated and aided by a body of noble gentlemen, who planned it as warning to the King to change his ways. Damiens bore the brunt of this conspiracy in silence while the aristocrats remained immune._NEWLINE_With the evidence of their crime, Gabrielle sets out to confront the Marquis de Saint-Lucque, the only person named in the letters, and succeeds in extorting a large amount of money from him. She also starts an affair with his son, Vicomte Fernand, who is oblivious to the whole situation. Before long Gabrielle is living in luxury and has aspirations to marry the young Vicomte. Her plans are dashed when Fernand breaks off their affair as the King has decided that the Vicomte should marry his illegitimate daughter, Neve de Nesle._NEWLINE_Furious, Gabrielle tries to blackmail Vicomte into marrying her using the letters which prove his father's guilt. But she has not counted on Neve's mother, Madame de Nesle, who on hearing of the situation, uses her position as the King's favourite to have Gabrielle, now 19, thrown into prison without trial._NEWLINE_She spends the next 16\\xc2\\xa0years in prison, feeding her rage and lust for revenge on the Saint-Lucque family. On 14 July 1789 she is released from the Bastille after it is stormed by the mob, the French Revolution having begun._NEWLINE_Mad for revenge, Gabrielle works her way into the favour of the men behind the new republic, and before long has become the public executioner of Artois. As France's only female executioner she is feared by many and known throughout Artois as Mam'zelle Guillotine._NEWLINE_When the Saint-Lucque family (Fernand, Neve and their three children) are captured as traitors, Gabrielle determines that finally she will have her revenge. English spies manage to rescue the Marquis and his young son, but his wife and two daughters are still in danger of being sent to the guillotine. Gabrielle fails to notice that the new sleuth sent from Paris by Chauvelin to track down the English spies is really the Scarlet Pimpernel in disguise.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nReception\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nThe character of Gabrielle has been interpreted as a 'figure of fun' yet also 'a highly dangerous opponent'. Sally Duggan notes that Orczy invokes biblical language to celebrate Gabrielle's downfall at the end of the book - depicting the Frenchwoman as 'a warning to all assertive females'.\"</td>\n",

Modern cars use either the Rotax 494, or Rotax 493 originally produced for Ski-Doo snowmobiles. Older cars, mostly used for Solo events these days use the Kawasaki 440/A engine. The AMW 500L-85/250-2 R2c engine, while legal for use in Formula 500 racing, is rarely used these days._NEWLINE_The Kawasaki 440/A engine, produced by Kawasaki, is a 436\\xc2\\xa0cc piston port engine utilizing 38\\xc2\\xa0mm Mikuni VM series carburetors and a tuned dual exhaust. While this engine is no longer competitive in road racing, it is still widely used in Solo II and Autocross events. Like all F500 engines, except for the AMW, the Kawasaki was originally produced as a snowmobile engine. It has been out of production since the early 1980s. Parts for these engines are becoming more difficult to find._NEWLINE_The AMW 500L-85 engine, built by Two Stroke International was introduced to F500 in 1994. It is a 497\\xc2\\xa0cc reed valve engine using twin 38\\xc2\\xa0mm Mikuni SuperBN carburetors. To keep the performance of these larger, more powerful engines in line with prior engines, SCCA mandates the use of a spec Y exhaust manifold and single tuned pipe on the AMW engine. Unlike the other engines used in F500, the AMW engine is a derivative of a light aircraft engine. This engine is no longer in production, and is not supported by the manufacturer._NEWLINE_Introduced for the 1997 season was the Rotax 494 engine. Rotax builds racing and industrial engines for a wide variety of applications, including aircraft, motorcycles, go-karts, snowmobiles and watercraft, The Rotax 494 engine is a 499cc rotary-valve engine. Like the AMW, the Rotax utilizes a 2 into 1 \"Y\" exhaust manifold and a single tuned expansion chamber exhaust. The Rotax engine utilizes the same 38\\xc2\\xa0mm Mikuni VM carburetors as the Kawasaki. The Rotax engine has become, by far, the most popular engine in F500 road racing. The Rotax 494 went out of production for Ski-Doo following the 2000 model year. Ski-Doo/Rotax ended support for it shortly thereafter. Some parts however, are still available through dealers and online outlets._NEWLINE_In 2004 SCCA added the Rotax 493 to the list of approved engines. The 493 has the same bore and stroke as the 494. However, unlike the 494, is a reed valve engine. It also runs Mikuni VM series carbs and the \"Y\" exhaust manifold like its cousin the 494. Cars running the 493 engine are required to run at a higher minimum weight to maintain parity with the older 494 and AMW engines. Like the 494, the 493 also went out of production for Ski-Doo following the 2003 model year. Support for it ended in 2007. As with the 494, some parts are still available through dealers and online outlets._NEWLINE_In 2011 SCCA added the Rotax 593 to the list of approved engines. The 593, (more commonly known as the Ski-Doo 500ss) is a 600cc version of the reed valve 493 engine. It also runs Mikuni VM series carbs and the \"Y\" exhaust manifold like the other Rotax engines, but are required to run a specified intake restrictor to keep power output on par with the 500cc 493 engine. Cars running the 593 engine are also required to run at a higher minimum weight to maintain parity with the older 494 and AMW engines. The 593 remains in production for Ski-Doo to date, rebadged from \"500ss\" to \"600\" in 2010._NEWLINE_Engine specifications are tightly regulated by the SCCA. No engine modifications are permitted in formula 500. Engines must be run in stock form \"as delivered\" from the factory. No aftermarket parts, port modifications, or other variations from stock configuration are allowed. This helps keep costs down and means close competition on the track.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nF500 transmission\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nF500 uses an advanced Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT), similar to that used in snowmobiles._NEWLINE_These simple belt driven automatic transmissions are tuned to optimize the power curve of a two-stroke engine, constantly keeping the engine at its peak power. One of the key benefits of the CVT is that it is a stepless transmission. This allows all of the engine\\'s power to be transmitted to the drive wheels at all times.'</td>\n",

Founded through a consolidation in 1889, Illinois Steel grew to become the largest steel producer in the United States. In 1898, several other steel and transportation companies were merged into it to form the Federal Steel Company, itself merged into U.S. Steel in 1901.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nHistory\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nThe first mill associated with the Illinois Steel Company was the North Chicago Rolling Mill, founded in Chicago, Illinois in 1857 as a mill to re-roll iron rails. In 1865, this mill was converted into a steel mill, shortly after the Bessemer process was introduced. The Illinois Steel Company was founded in 1899 following the consolidation of three companies. The North Chicago Rolling Mill Company had plants in Chicago, South Chicago, Chicago (1880), and Milwaukee, Wisconsin (1868). The Union Iron Company (1863) of Chicago and the Joliet Steel Company (1870) were also involved in the merge. The company was based in the Rookery Building in downtown Chicago. Branch offices operated in the Empire Building in New York, New York; the Pioneer Press Building in Saint Paul, Minnesota; the Cuyahoga Building in Cleveland, Ohio; the Security Building in St. Louis, Missouri; and an office in Denver, Colorado._NEWLINE_The Illinois Steel Company became the largest steel company in the state. The company also owned a controlling interest in the Chicago, Lake Shore and Eastern Railway, coal mines in West Virginia and Pennsylvania, iron mines in Michigan and Wisconsin, and limestone mines in Indiana. Illinois Steel grew to become the largest steel and iron producer in the country by the late 1880s, (As did Carnegie and Lackawanna) producing over 1.1 million tons of pig iron and about one million tons of steel. The company specialized in rail track (including rail, fastenings, and ties), steel bars, steel plates, mineral wool, wire, pig iron, and hydraulic Portland cement. Railroads using Illinois Steel products included the Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe, Wabash, Chicago & Alton, and Baltimore & Ohio. Pig iron operations were handled in conjunction with Pickands, Brown & Company._NEWLINE_The success of Illinois Steel did not go unchecked. The Carnegie Steel Company had a more efficient operation in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and sought to force Illinois Steel into receivership. Carnegie sold steel near Chicago at only eighteen dollars a ton, forcing Illinois Steel to sell their products below production cost. By 1896, Illinois Steel had drawn papers to place the company into receivership. Before these papers could be filed, however, Illinois Steel decided to focus on expanding their market to the west of Chicago, where Carnegie lacked sufficient supply lines. The strategy proved successful._NEWLINE_In 1898, the Illinois Steel Company acquired the Minnesota Iron Company, Lorain Steel Company of Ohio, the Johnson Company of Pennsylvania, and the Elgin, Joliet & Eastern Railway, forming the Federal Steel Company. Upon completion of the merge, general counsel Elbert Henry Gary became president of the company. In February 1901, Gary worked with J. P. Morgan to have him acquire Carnegie Steel. Days after the acquisition was approved, Gray announced his intent to merge Federal Steel into Carnegie to form what would be known as U.S. Steel.

After thirty years, a degree program within the Department of Engineering was established in 1906, under the direction of Emil Lorch, who served to administer the program and its ever-evolving iterations until 1937. Housed in what is now Lorch Hall on Central Campus, the program quickly grew into the Department of Architecture by 1913. In 1923, world-renowned architect Eliel Saarinen joined the faculty of the department, with which he was associated during his design, construction, and subsequent presidency of the Cranbrook Academy of Art. By 1930, the College of Architecture had been established and grew to become the College of Architecture and Design in 1939, introducing Landscape Architecture and, by 1948, one of the first Master of City Planning degrees. The 1940s also saw the college taking a progressive role with regards to architectural research, establishing the Architecture Research Laboratory that would pioneer the integration of design, construction, technology, planning and research. In 1965, the Landscape Architecture program moved to the university's School of Natural Resources._NEWLINE_In 1968, the college made history by establishing the first-ever doctoral program in architecture, fueled by a strong level of academic inquiry into the field._NEWLINE_In 1974, many positive changes took place in the college, including the separation of programs into the College of Architecture & Urban Planning and the School of Art & Design. During this same year, the programs outgrew their home on Central Campus and found a new home on North Campus, the Art and Architecture Building, in which both schools remain to this day.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nUrban planning and design\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nThe urban and regional planning program was recently ranked 13th in the nation in Planetizen's 2014 Guide to Graduate Urban Planning Programs. The urban design program was recognized by New Urban News as the 4th best program in the nation for new urbanism.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nFacilities\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nTaubman College is located on the University of Michigan's North Campus in the Art & Architecture Building (A&AB). This building houses the largest academic studio in the world, at 30,000 continuous square feet, for roughly 450 undergraduate and graduate architecture students and graduate urban design students._NEWLINE_On September 8, 2017, Taubman College opened the new A. Alfred Taubman Wing which provides an additional 36,000 square feet to the original 72,000 square foot facility, and the project includes a renovation of the existing college facilities. Architecture and urban planning education increasingly calls on spaces for group work and spaces to design and build. The wing and renovations provide additional studio space per student and collaboration rooms, as well as 5,700 square foot commons space which will also be used to host conferences, final reviews, and other special events. Designed by Preston Scott Cohen, Inc. (Design Architect) with Integrated Design Solutions (IDS) (Architect of Record), the building addition's internal architecture is composed around a series of remarkable spiral-like stairs and ramps that create perambulatory sequences carefully choreographed to create encounters between faculty and students. Externally, a saw-tooth roof reflects warm light, unifying the orthogonal geometry of the studio with the hexagonal and ramped commons. A plaza underneath the new building provides and outside gathering and exhibition space to foster community. The building addition and renovation project was funded by a major gift from the late A. Alfred Taubman, as well as a generous gift from the late King C. Stutzman, additional funds from the U-M Offices of the President, Provost, and Chief Financial Officer, and the support of alumni and friends. The total budget for the entire project (addition and renovation of existing facilities) is $28.5 million._NEWLINE_In fall 2009, the Taubman College completed a renovation of its Digital Fabrication Laboratory, or FABLab. The two-story space houses 7,000\\xc2\\xa0sq\\xc2\\xa0ft (650\\xc2\\xa0m\\xc2\\xb2). of computer-controlled fabrication equipment. The list of machines includes a 30\\xe2\\x80\\x99x10\\xe2\\x80\\x99x8\\xe2\\x80\\x99 7 axis robotic work cell, two additional robotic work cells, two 4\\xe2\\x80\\x99x8\\xe2\\x80\\x99 CNC routers, a 4\\xe2\\x80\\x99x8\\xe2\\x80\\x99 abrasive water jet cutting machine, a Zund knife cutter, and a CNC milling machine. These machines give students and faculty the capability to digitally fabricate using any material at full scale. In addition the FABLab operates three rapid prototyping machines, and four laser cutters. A fully outfitted woodworking and welding shop complements the FABLab. http://taubmancollege.umich.edu/fablab/_NEWLINE_North Campus is also home to the College of Engineering, the School of Computer Science, the School of Music, Theatre & Dance, and the Penny W.

For reasons that were never explained, he travelled to the UK on March 12, 1999, with the intention of visiting Newcastle, but in fact went to Titchfield in Hampshire instead. He spent the evening of 12 March at the Abshot Hotel and Country Club with at least four other people, before getting a taxi to Bishop's Waltham with two men (John Howett and Juan Arribas) and a woman. An argument broke out however between Palmer and his two male companions, and the trio left the cab. Arribas and Howett returned to the cab without Palmer and drove off. Palmer was never seen again. His suitcase was never recovered, nor was the taxi driver ever identified.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nDevelopments\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nHowett and Arribas claimed that they fought with Palmer and left him lying on the ground of an industrial estate, still alive._NEWLINE_In 2003, Hampshire police stated that they were treating Palmer's disappearance as suspicious. Howett was arrested and his home was searched for clues, although he was never charged due to insufficient evidence. At the time, Howett was serving a 12-year sentence for drug smuggling. Another man was interviewed in Spain. _NEWLINE_A 2009 inquest into Palmer's disappearance resulted in an open verdict, since the coroner felt there was not enough evidence of unlawful killing, although he did also accuse Howett and Arribas of not telling the truth. Witnesses told conflicting stories of what happened afterwards - either Palmer died and his corpse was buried; or alternatively he recovered, went to Newcastle and was never seen again. _NEWLINE_In 2014, police searched the garden of a pub in Fareham for evidence that Palmer was buried there, but found no clues.\"</td>\n",

Tauris\\n_START_SECTION_\\nHistory\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nI.B.Tauris was founded in 1983. Its declared strategy was to fill the perceived gap between trade publishing houses and university presses\\xe2\\x80\\x94that is, to publish serious but accessible works on international politics and culture. The company specialised in its early days on publishing on the Middle East._NEWLINE_The publisher now specialises in non-fiction books on art, history (medieval and modern), politics and International Relations, the Middle East and Islamic world generally, religion, geography and environment, and visual culture (including film, photography and contemporary art). Its books are aimed primarily at the specialist market including academics and students. However, because of strong current interest in its preferred topics, the company also sells to a general audience. In the period following the September 11 attacks, for example, its publication Taliban by Ahmed Rashid is reported to have sold nearly 500,000 copies in English worldwide with 27 licensed editions internationally._NEWLINE_Tauris Parke Paperbacks is a paperback imprint of the firm that concentrates on travel writing, popular history and biography._NEWLINE_In May 2011, the company acquired the fine arts publisher Philip Wilson Publishers after handling its sales, marketing, and distribution for several years._NEWLINE_In June 2013, the company announced an agreement with the American University in Cairo Press (AUCP) under which I.B. Tauris distributes all AUCP publications worldwide outside North America and Egypt. The two publishing houses also embarked on a series of international co-publications. This move was reportedly in line with an I.B.Tauris strategy to be the dominant player in international Middle East Studies publishing._NEWLINE_In 2018, I.B. Tauris was acquired by Bloomsbury Publishing, where it continues as an imprint.'</td>\n",

It typically forms under low-temperature highly acidic conditions. It occurs in sedimentary rocks (shales, limestones and low grade coals) as well as in low temperature hydrothermal veins. Commonly associated minerals include pyrite, pyrrhotite, galena, sphalerite, fluorite, dolomite and calcite._NEWLINE_As a primary mineral it forms nodules, concretions and crystals in a variety of sedimentary rock, such as in the chalk layers found on both sides of the English Channel at Dover, Kent, England and at Cap Blanc Nez, Pas De Calais, France, where it forms as sharp individual crystals and crystal groups, and nodules (similar to those shown here). _NEWLINE_As a secondary mineral it forms by chemical alteration of a primary mineral such as pyrrhotite or chalcopyrite.\\n_START_SECTION_\\nAlteration\\n_START_PARAGRAPH_\\nMarcasite reacts more readily than pyrite under conditions of high humidity. The product of this disintegration is iron(II) sulfate and sulfuric acid. The hydrous iron sulfate forms a white powder consisting of the mineral melanterite, FeSO\\xe2\\x82\\x84\\xc2\\xb77H\\xe2\\x82\\x82O._NEWLINE_This disintegration of marcasite in mineral collections is known as \"pyrite decay\". When a specimen goes through pyrite decay, the marcasite reacts with moisture and oxygen in the air, the sulfur oxidizing and combining with water to produce sulfuric acid that attacks other sulfide minerals and mineral labels. Low humidity (less than 60%) storage conditions prevents or slows the reaction.'</td>\n",

              "'b\" \\n Jeremy Akerman \\n Political career \\n In the provincial election of May 30, 1967, Akerman ran for the first time as an NDP candidate, in the constituency of Cape Breton West, and won 13 per cent of the vote. In the following year, he ran as the party\\'s candidate in the federal election in Cape Richmond, and won 7,750 votes. He placed third, but in Glace Bay, Akerman won three wards out of six. He decided to run in the Glace Bay provincial constituency in the next provincial election. Later in 1968, the NDP held a convention at Sydney, at which Akerman sought the party\\'s provincial leadership. He was opposed by law professor Keith Jobson of Halifax, who was backed by outgoing leader James H. Aitchison, and won the contest by four votes becoming party leader at the age of 26. The next provincial election was held October 13, 1970. Akerman was elected in Glace Bay with a majority of 1,527 votes. Sydney school teacher Paul MacEwan was also elected, so the party held two seats in the Legislature until 1974. In the vote held April 2, 1974, Akerman and MacEwan were both re-elected, along with a third candidate, James \\'Buddy\\' MacEachern, who ran in Cape Breton Centre, a riding sandwiched between Akerman\\'s seat and MacEwan\\'s.  And in the following provincial election, held September 19, 1978, these three were re-elected, and Len Arsenault won in the constituency of Cape Breton North, thus bringing the NDP presence in the Nova Scotia Legislature up to four seats. During his years as head of the NDP in Nova Scotia, Akerman had met increased resistance to his efforts from the Halifax branch of the party which was critical of the party\\'s inability to win seats on the mainland.  Through gaining a majority of seats on the party\\'s provincial executive, the Halifax group came to dominate the party, even although they were unable win a seat in the Legislature.  Akerman also faced strains on his health and personal life, due to the stress of the workload he carried; he missed the 1977 session of the House because of an illness and his marriage ended in divorce.  By 1980, reportedly tired after 12 years at the helm of the party, he announced his retirement. At the time he was the longest-serving NDP leader anywhere in Canada. Soon afterwards, Akerman received a contract from the provincial government to become executive director of intergovernmental affairs. In order to accept a job in the civil service he severed his ties with the NDP. He worked in this position or other provincial government posts for the next eleven years. Following this, he served for a time as editor of the Metro Telecaster, then pursued a career in acting. He has appeared in at least 24 movies, including Cloudburst, Hobo with a Shotgun and Blackbird. During his time as NDP leader in Nova Scotia, Akerman earned a high level of respect from all political parties and was considered one of the ablest debaters in the House. Akerman attempted a return to politics in a March 6, 2001 byelection in the provincial constituency of Halifax Fairview. This time running as candidate for the Nova Scotia Liberal Party, Akerman finished second behind NDP candidate Graham Steele.\"b\" \\n River Misbourne \\n History \\n In 1906 the Great Western Railway (GWR) constructed the Chalfont Viaduct to carry trains between London and High Wycombe across the river. In the mid-1980s, when the M25 was being constructed, the Misbourne was diverted under the motorway via underground concrete culverts. The route of the motorway was then aligned to pass through the arches of the Chalfont Viaduct. \\n Flow \\n The Misbourne has for some years had intermittently reduced or stopped flow because of abstraction for supply from the aquifers feeding it.  The low flow caused its course to be neglected or partially obstructed, so when the water companies undertook remedial measures which restored the flow, there were episodes of flooding in Chalfont St Peter and Chalfont St Giles village centres. Later work has restored the integrity of the course, and floods have not occurred since then. The river is a \\'perch\\' stream, flowing over a bed of impermeable material on top of a porous substrate. This state is only quasi-stable, since in periods of low rainfall the water table drops below the level of the impermeable layer. If ground works are then carried out which damage this layer, the river can sink into the porous substrate and disappear. The upper part of the river was dry for over 3 years starting in November 2003 but re-appeared in February 2007 following several months of above-average rainfall which raised the water table.\"b\\' \\n Olshanka, Belgorod Oblast \\n Olshanka (Russian: is a rural locality (a selo) in Chernyansky District of Belgorod Oblast, Russia.\\'b\\' \\n Former Residence of Ding Richang \\n History \\n The former residence was built in memory of Ding Xianba the father of Ding Richang, in 1878 after his retirement. Ding died there on 27 February 1882. It was designated as a municipal level cultural heritage in 1993 and then a provincial level cultural preservation unit in 2008. In March 2013, it was listed among the seventh group of \"Major National Historical and Cultural Sites in Guangdong\" by the State Council of China. \\n Architecture \\n It has an area of about 6,100-square-metre consists of 99 rooms and halls.\\'b\" \\n Old Woman Mountains Wilderness \\n Geography \\n The area consists of bajadas (extensive flat aprons of alluvium) and the massive, fault-lifted Old Woman Mountains that extend some 35 miles north-south and up to 28 miles in an east-west direction. The elevations within the wilderness range from 800 feet in the drainage bottoms to over 5,300 feet at the top of Old Woman Peak. The mountains take their name from a granite monolith resembling the figure of an old woman, known as the Old Woman Statue (5,000 feet high). \\n Ecology \\n The Old Woman Mountains Wilderness falls within a transition zone between the Lower Colorado and Mojave deserts and encompasses many different habitat types. Creosote bush scrub dominates the lower elevations, grading into mixed desert scrub at middle elevations with juniper-pinyon woodland at the higher elevations. The dry washes are characterized by catclaw acacia, cheesebush, desert lavender, little-leaf ratany, and desert almond. Wildlife is typical for the Mojave Desert; including a permanent population of bighorn sheep, mule deer, bobcat, cougar, coyote, black-tailed jackrabbit, ground squirrels, kangaroo rats, quail, chuckar, roadrunners, rattlesnakes, and several species of lizards. Numerous raptor species are likely to be found in the area; including prairie falcons, red-tailed hawks, golden eagles, Cooper\\'s hawks, American kestrels, as well as several species of owls. The washes and canyons provide good habitat for several species of songbirds, and the bird densities and diversity is further enhanced by the presence of the known 24 springs and seeps. The bajadas provide excellent desert tortoise habitat; 49,683 acres of the wilderness area have been identified as critical habitat for the threatened desert tortoise.\"b\" \\n Federico Cecon \\n Federico Cecon (born 11 June 1994) is an Italian ski jumper. He is the son of the Italian former ski jumper Roberto Cecon (born 1971). \\n Biography \\n He competed for Italy at the 2018 Winter Olympics. In the men\\'s normal hill, he finished 49th in qualifying with 87.9 points and advanced to the final round. Cecon had previously competed at the 2015 World Championships, finishing 48th in the individual normal hill, 49th in the individual large hill, and 12th in the team large hill.\"b\" \\n Peter Bayley (scholar of French literature) \\n Biography \\n Peter Bayley was born in Redruth, Cornwall, and was educated at Redruth Grammar School. In 1963, he went up to Emmanuel College, Cambridge to read modern and mediaeval languages (French and Spanish); in 1966, he graduated with a First. He continued at Emmanuel as a postgraduate student, and in 1969 was elected to a Research Fellowship. In 1971, he was awarded his PhD for a thesis on 17th-century French sermons. That same year, he was appointed to a college lectureship at, and was elected Fellow of, Gonville and Caius College. In 1974, he was appointed university assistant lecturer in the Department of French; and in 1978, university lecturer. In 1982, Peter Rickard retired as Drapers Professor of French. Bayley was appointed acting head of department. The process of electing a new Drapers Professor was a protracted one, and he was installed in the chair only in 1985. At that time, it was unusual for Cambridge professors to supervise undergraduates; but Bayley did. Other offices he took on were: various college posts; 1989-1997, vice-president of the Association of University Professors and Heads of French; 1990-1992, president of the Society for French Studies; 1994-1996, member of the executive of the University Council for Modern Languages; and 2000-2002, chairman of the (newly formed) School of Arts and Humanities at Cambridge. In 2006, he suffered a stroke, and a bad fall. He never fully recovered his faculties, and was unable to complete his monograph on the oratory of Bossuet (1627-1704). His friends had the novel and distressing experience of finding themselves the dominant partners in conversations. In 2011, he retired, and was presented by his colleagues with a volume in his honour containing contributions by leading scholars from the United Kingdom, France and North America. He increasingly spent his days at the house in Northamptonshire he shared with his life partner Angus Bowie, classicist, of The Queen\\'s College, Oxford; who delivered the eulogy at his funeral in Caius Chapel on 4 May 2018. \\n Honours \\n In 1988, Bayley was made an Officier (Officer) of the Ordre des Palmes by France. In 2006, he was promoted to Commandeur (Commander): this is the highest rank of the order and he was the first British academic under retirement age to achieve it.\"b\" \\n Fingal Head Light \\n History \\n The station was first established on 19 February 1872, a wooden pole structure of approximately 30 feet holding a fixed kerosene wick burner which shone a fixed white light with an intensity of It was described by a daughter of William Arnold, the first lighthouse keeper, as being shaped like a large meat safe, mounted on a wooden structure resembling a pigeon loft. The keeper had to row from the Tweed Heads Pilot Station each day and light the lantern at sunset, and a hut was constructed for him to stay in. In October 1878 the Maritime Board of New South Wales decided to construct a modern lighthouse at the location. It was the third of five lighthouses of similar design designed by James Barnet in the other four being Richmond River Light, Clarence River Light (now demolished), Tacking Point Lighthouse and Crowdy Head Light. It originally had a porch and an annexe serving as oil room. A four-room, single-storey lighthouse keeper\\'s house was constructed about 20 metres northwest of the tower. The lighthouse and keeper\\'s cottage were constructed by Joseph William Mortley and Shepherd who were successful with their government tender. On 15 June 1920 the light was converted to an automatic carbide lamp (acetylene gas) apparatus, with an intensity of and altered to group flashing. Soon after, the station was demanned and all buildings other than the tower were demolished. In 1980 the light was converted to electricity. The current light source is a modern FA-251 Beacon with a HL-2000 quartz halogen lamp. It is fed by mains electricity with a Battery standby. It revolves once every 30 seconds. The current light characteristic is a flash every five seconds, red to east and white to other directions (Fl.W.R. 5s). It is partially obscured. \\n Structure \\n The circular tower is made from bricks and cement rendered from the outside. It is capped by an oversailing bluestone platform at 12 feet above ground levels, supported by shaped bluestone corbels. The platform is surrounded by a handrail of metal standards and rails. It is topped by the domed lantern housing the optical apparatus, a fourth order catadioptric. \\n Site operation \\n The light is operated by Roads and Maritime Services (formerly NSW Maritime). The site is managed by the New South Wales Department of Lands. \\n Visiting \\n The light is accessible by road from the Pacific Highway just south of the Tweed River. Parking is provided, and there is also a public beach and a picnic area just north of the lighthouse. The tower itself, however, is closed to the public.\"b\\' \\n Khanakul \\n Demographics \\n As per the 2011 Census of India, Khanakul had a total population of 3,489 of which 1,756 (50%) were males and 1,733 (50%) were females.

After being elected in 2011 to the position of Head of Online Media at University Radio university\\\\\\'s student radio developed FRANCESCA, a station management system and console for the UK\\\\\\'s Radioplayer application. Usborne submitted his system for consideration in the Best Technical Innovation category at the 2013 Student Radio Awards, and was awarded gold that November. The judges described his application as \"a real innovation\". The following year, Usborne developed Responsive Radio, a \"new approach to broadcasting\", which incorporated ReQuester, an application he had developed that provided feedback to radio presenters about the musical preferences of their listeners. He submitted Responsive Radio with the United Station Management application for consideration in the 2014 Radio Academy Awards. In May that year, Usborne became the first university student to win in a technical category at the Radio Academy Awards, when he received bronze in the Best Technical Innovation category, beating out competition from both Global Radio and the BBC. The judges described the entry as \"a great example of technical innovation creating listener benefit\", saying that it was \"particularly impressive\" that it had been created by \"a student station with presumably little resource\". Responsive Radio and Unified Station Management were also nominated for the Arqiva TechCon Technical Excellence Award in September 2014. In November, Usborne won gold for Responsive Radio in the Best Technical Achievement category at the 2014 Student Radio Awards. In April 2014, Usborne was elected to the positions of Station Manager of University Radio Bath and Deputy Events Officer of the Student Radio Association; the following month, he set up and ran the first fully-radio-with-pictures edition of the Student Radio Chart Show. In October, Usborne was named as one of the Radio Academy\\\\\\'s \"30 Under 30\" of the year.

Heller School \\n History and architectural features \\n With educational activities having taken place on this site as early as 1795, this historic property was considered by historians to the oldest public school site in continuous use in the region at the time of its closing in 1953. Built on this site in 1883, the George K. Heller School (Cheltenham Center for the Arts) was designed to house the first Cheltenham High School; it was then subsequently expanded in 1893 and 1906 with other additions erected in 1963 and 1969 after the structure was converted to the Cheltenham Center for the Arts. Ranging from 1 1/2- to 2 1/2-stories, this stone school has intersecting gable roofs, topped by a square cupola. \\n Placement on the National Register of Historic Places \\n The NRHP nomination application for the George K. Heller School was formally reviewed by Pennsylvania\\'s Historic Preservation Board at its March 13, 2001 meeting at 9:45 a.m. at the State Museum in Harrisburg. Also considered for NRHP status at this time were the: Protection of the Flag Monument in Athens, Pennsylvania; Normandy Farm and Upper Roxborough Historic District in Montgomery County; Awbury Historic District and Harris/Laird, Schober & Company Building in Philadelphia; Michael Derstine Farmstead in Bucks County; Chester Heights Camp Meeting Historic District in Delaware County; John Nicholas and Elizabeth Moyer House in Berks County; William Shelly School and Annex in York County; and the Zeta Psi Fraternity House in Northampton County.

He studied Political and Social Science at the University of Victoria, and graduated in 2004 with a master\\'s degree from Royal Roads University while co-editing Border Security in the Era of Al Qaeda with John Winterdyk. In 2013 Sundberg completed his doctor of philosophy at Monash University, focusing on a comparative study of border enforcement issues between Canada and Australia in his thesis Comparing approaches to internal immigration enforcement: a study of Australia and Canada. \\n Field work \\n Sundberg joined Canada Customs (later Canada Customs and Revenue Agency, and later still Canada Border Services Agency) in 1993. During his 14-year service, Sundberg held various field positions, including customs officer, immigration officer, inland immigration enforcement officer, superintendent (not to be confused with a superintendent in a Canadian police service), border services officer, senior policy officer, and counsel. His service earned him several citations from Citizenship and Immigration Canada, the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation, as well as other organizations, for such achievements as the apprehension of a top 10 most wanted fugitive, and contribution to the recovery of abducted children. \\n Academic career \\n Sundberg has been an Associate Professor in the Department of Economics, Justice, and Policy Studies at Mount Royal University since 2006. He also holds an Adjunct Associate Professor position at the University of Calgary in the Faculty of Environmental Design, an Adjunct Professor position in the Adelaide Law School at the University of Adelaide, and a fellowship with the Canadian Global Affairs Institute. He is an active scholar and researcher in the areas of national security, immigration enforcement, policing methodologies, and crime reduction through design, and is involved with a number of university and community committees. Sundberg was recognized in Kristi 2012 book Teaching Justice: Solving Social Justice Problems through University Education as an Innovator in the teaching of justice studies. Sundberg, along with Filipuzzi and Trussler, developed and patented the SAFE Design Standard.  In 2014 Sundberg was approached by Dan Levinson to form a non-profit center of excellence on methodologies relating to policing and security. Together they held consultations with ministers and deputy minister of public safety and security, chiefs of police, heads of intelligence sections, and other senior security and law enforcement officials in North America, the United Kingdom, and Australia. Sundberg and Levinson then turned to community and corporate leaders in order to garner their interest in actively participating in such an initiative. This undertaking lasted eighteen months, and resulted in positive responses from officials and the public, bringing Sundberg and Levinson to formally establish the Public Safety and Security Research Group, with Dr. Michele Braun, MBA at MRU.  Sundberg is a regular contributor on regional, national, and international news media regarding border security, public safety, crime, grievance-based violence, and terrorism, and is recognized as one of Western Canada\\'s foremost criminologists.\"b\\' \\n Cutler School (New York City) \\n The Cutler School of New York was a primary through college preparatory boys\\\\\\' school initially located at 713 6th Ave., between 23rd and 24th Street, only a few blocks from the Roosevelt home in Manhattan, New York City, New York.  Classes were originally held on the second floor above Burns Oyster and Chop House.  The school was established in October 1876 by Arthur Hamilton Cutler. (A.B., Harvard 1870; Ph.D., Princeton 1885).  The school\\\\\\'s founder tutored Theodore Roosevelt, his brother, Elliott Roosevelt, his sister, Corinne Roosevelt, and his future wife, Edith Carow.  According to the New York Times,  Theodore Roosevelt was the first graduate of the school, although Roosevelt\\\\\\'s autobiography merely refers to Cutler as his \"tutor\" for three years, from 1873 until he entered Harvard in 1876. Advertising for the school began in the New York Times on September 20, 1876 which said that design of this class is to thoroughly prepare boys for our best  The initial enrollment was limited to just twelve pupils, boys aged eight to eighteen.  Classes began on September 26, 1876.  Within two years, by 1878, the school moved from the second floor of the restaurant to 20 West 43rd Street (between 5th and 6th Avenues).  The size of the school doubled and the students were divided into a Senior Division and a Junior Division.   By 1884 the school was large enough to put forward a football team of eleven players. In 1885 it changed its name to Arthur Cutler\\\\\\'s School for Boys and by 1893 it was considered to be one of the leading secondary schools in the eastern United States, along with the St. Paul\\\\\\'s School in Garden City and the Berkeley School for Boys located a block away at 20 West 44th Street.  Because of their close proximity the Cutler and Berkeley Schools would become rivals both on and off the athletic field. In November 1894 a Harvard-Yale football game called the at Hampden took place.  Upwards of five players were hospitalized with injuries during the match. Following victory, rival fans took the pattern of violence into the streets. Afterwards the Harvard-Yale football game was suspended indefinitely.  A number of Cutler graduates were involved in Harvard football at the time, and Theodore Roosevelt was advocating for the suspension to be lifted.   In 1895 Arthur Cutler was named the President of the Schoolmaster\\\\\\'s Association of New York and he lobbied to restore the game, and invited Walter Camp to speak to the Schoolmaster\\\\\\'s Association of New York about the importance of athletics to the development of young men. In 1893 the Cutler School was relocated to 20 East 50th St., across the street from St. Patrick\\\\\\'s Cathedral.  It now had over 200 pupils and 23 instructors.  Tuition was $250 per term or $400 for the full year.  It 1898 it was renamed as \"The Cutler School.\"  In 1900 Arthur Cutler was the temporary chairman who presided over the founding of the New York Interscholastic Athletic Association. In April 1911 Cutler invited former President Theodore Roosevelt to speak at The Cutler School.  Roosevelt declined citing the \"literally thousands of similar requests\" that he has received.  At the time he is considering running again for the Presidency against Taft. The majority of Cutler graduates entered Harvard, Columbia, Yale, and Princeton, the numbers being in the order named. The school to 49 and 51 East 61st Street to Madison Avenue after 1913. Although the school advertised for students in October 1923, the school property at 755 Madison Avenue was sold in January 1924. On December 31, 1917 Arthur Cutler\\\\\\'s wife, Elizabeth Cutler (67), was badly burned in her home at 49 East 61st Street in Manhattan.  She arose early in the morning and used a match to light the gas logs in the fireplace on the first floor of her home.  She was wearing only a bathrobe, which ignited.  She ran from the house and rolled in a snowdrift in an attempt to extinguish the flames.  Her husband was asleep on the second floor of the house and didn\\\\\\'t become aware of the incident until a policeman awoke him and advised him that his wife had been taken to Flower Hospital.  She died in the hospital two days later. On June 21, 1918, the last day of the 1917-1918 school year, Dr. Arthur Hamilton Cutler died at his home from a cerebral venous sinus thrombosis.  He was 70 years old. He had been headmaster of the school for 42 years. The school moved to 755 Madison Avenue following the death of Dr. Cutler, in 1918.\\'b\\' \\n Wilsford Henge \\n Description \\n Wilsford Henge is a broad irregular circular ditch visible only as a cropmark on aerial photographs. It is situated on a gently sloping spur of land to the south of the River Avon. The internal diameter of the enclosure is around 43 metres and the external diameter is around 62 metres. There is an entrance, 12 metres wide, which faces northeast in the direction of the river. Around 1 kilometre in a north by northwest direction lies Marden Henge on the opposite bank of the River Avon. An interior circle of possible post-hole pits has been confirmed by geophysical survey. \\n Archaeology \\n The site is included in a three-year investigation of the Pewsey Vale, beginning in 2015, by the Department of Archaeology at the University of Reading. Among the discoveries in the 2015 excavations was an early Bronze Age crouched burial of an adolescent child which included sherds of beaker pottery and a collection of necklace beads. Nearby, within the same field, archaeologists have discovered the remnants of a large Roman farm settlement, and excavations have revealed the outline of a very large farm building or barn.\\'b\\' \\n Dendronotus \\n Description \\n Dendronotus has an elongated, broad body, with 4 to 8 pairs of branched cerata on the notum. Animals in this genus have an obvious oral veil with 2 to 5 extensions. These extensions may be branched. Smaller unbranched extensions are found around the mouth.  The rhinophores are surrounded by a sheath and the sheath itself has branched extensions. A large extension is found on the side at the base of each rhinophore. The anal opening occurs between the first and second set of dorsal cerata on the right side of the body. \\n Diet \\n This genus feeds on hydroids, as reflected by its serrated radula.\\'b\\' \\n Machoi Peak \\n Climbing history and routes \\n Machoi Peak was first surveyed by a British medical team headed by Dr Ernest Neve in 1912. It was latter climbed by a team of Indian army on 10 September 1984. The easiest route to climb Mechoi Peak is from the right side of Amarnath cave which leads to its west face, starts from Baltal a 20 kilometers high altitude alpine tract leads to the foothills of the peak. From the north side it is steep and one has to cross the whole Machoi glacier with ridges and falling ice. The east face of the peak is more difficult due to the remoteness of the area which starts from Matayan, Dras.\\'b\" \\n Luis (Colombian footballer) \\n Junior \\n was born in Barrancas, La Guajira, and was included in Colombia\\'s 22-man squad for the 2015 Copa Americana de Pueblos due to his Wayuu ethnicity.

Meanwhile, Jack reconnects with a friend from high school, Nancy Donovan (Julianne Moore), and ponders the possibility of romance as Nancy\\\\\\'s marriage is falling apart. When Liz ends up buying an expensive necktie that Jack already owns, they agree to spend zero dollars on their gifts. Jack gets Liz a program from her performance of The Crucible framed in wood from her high school stage and does not reimburse his office assistant, Jonathan (Maulik Pancholy) for fuel costs. In return, Liz calls in a bomb threat to Penn Station, keeping Nancy in New York, and finally Jack arranges for Liz to fulfill her dream of meeting Larry Wilcox as Officer Jon Baker from the show CHiPs. TGS producer Pete Hornberger (Scott Adsit) learns that the new actor on the show, Danny, is a talented singer. Despite Danny\\\\\\'s lack of interest in singing on the show, Pete gives him the Christmas solo as revenge for Jenna not chipping in to tip the cleaning ladies, which is a yearly source of frustration for Pete. Jenna is outraged when she hears Danny was assigned the solo, and tries to get Subhas the janitor to punch Danny in the throat. But when the agreeable Danny learns of Jenna\\\\\\'s hurt feelings, he arranges for them to perform a duet, in which he sings off-key to make Jenna look good. Meanwhile, Kenneth is throwing his rule-filled \"Secret Santa Fun Swap\", much to the writers\\\\\\' chagrin. Frank, Toofer, and Lutz proclaim they are strict adherents of \"Verdukianism,\" a religion they make up on the spot, and have Kenneth give them things they claim to need for \"Merlinpeen,\" the Verdukian Holiday of Mouth Pleasures (such as meat-lover\\\\\\'s pizza and having their teeth flossed by a blonde virgin). Their famous holiday song is, \"Oh, Meatbowl of Verduke, you bring me such pizza. Meatbowl.\" When Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) tells Kenneth that they made up their religion, he goes into shock at the idea that all religions are made up by man. His faith is restored when the three are arrested for the bomb threat Liz called in, using their phone. \\n Production \\n \"Secret Santa\" was written by series\\\\\\' creator, executive producer and lead actress Tina Fey. The director of this episode was Beth McCarthy-Miller, a long-time television director who worked with Fey on the sketch comedy show Saturday Night Live. This was Fey\\\\\\'s nineteenth writing credit, and McCarthy-Miller\\\\\\'s ninth directed episode. \"Secret Santa\" originally aired on NBC as the eighth episode of the show\\\\\\'s fourth season, and the 66th overall episode of the series, in the United States on December 10, 2009. It was filmed on November 5 and November 20, 2009. In November 2009, it was announced that actress Julianne Moore would guest star on 30 Rock as a love interest for Alec Baldwin\\\\\\'s character, Jack Donaghy. Moore would later guest star in the episodes \"Winter Madness\", \"Lee Marvin vs. Derek Jeter\", \"Emanuelle Goes to Dinosaur Land\", and \"I Do Do\". In an interview with USA Today in October 2009, Fey said that Jack would find more enduring love in the upcoming season. \"As we move into the back half of the season, we\\\\\\'d like to get [Jack] into a real adult relationship with some hurdles.\" In the same interview, Baldwin noted, \"Fifty-year-old Jack running around still using women like a drug is not where I\\\\\\'d like him to end up.\" Actor Larry Wilcox made a cameo in this episode, though, he was in character playing Officer Jon Baker from his old days in the drama show CHiPs, as Liz Lemon had a teen crush on Wilcox. In one scene of this episode, Liz says \"shark farts\", and when asked about it in an April 2010 interview, Fey revealed that the term \"was one that we ad-libbed that we ended up leaving in. The studio asked us not to leave it in, but we left it in.\" This was actor Cheyenne Jackson\\\\\\'s second appearance as Danny on 30 Rock. He made his debut in the November 12, 2009, episode \"The Problem Solvers\". Fey had seen Jackson in the Broadway musicals Xanadu and Damn Yankees, the latter that starred Jane Krakowski, who plays Jenna Maroney on the show. According to Jackson in a November 2009 interview, Fey set up a meeting to interest him in a role on the program. In an interview with the Los Angeles Times, it was revealed that it was Krakowski who brought Jackson to the attention of the 30 Rock producers. In the episode, Danny sang off-key during a duet with Jenna, in order to keep her happy. In regards of his off-pitch performance, Jackson said in an interview, \"It\\\\\\'s actually harder than you might think. I worked on it a lot to make it sound real and to make it sound believable. But I got some good, funny feedback from it, so I\\\\\\'m glad it worked out.\" One filmed scene from \"Secret Santa\" was cut out from the airing. Instead, the scene was featured on 30 Rock\\\\\\'s season four DVD as part of the deleted scenes in the Bonus feature. In the scene, Liz goes to Vattene, a men\\\\\\'s dress apparel retailer. She is there to buy a gift for Jack for Christmas but is shocked at the prices. She then sees a red neck tie and purchases it. \\n Cultural references \\n Jack tells Liz about YouFace, \"an up-and-coming social-networking site\", similar to that of MySpace and Facebook. The song Liz sings for Jack\\\\\\'s Christmas gift is a parody of the song Anyone Else but You originally by The Moldy Peaches featured in the film Juno. Liz revealed that she played John Proctor \"in a gender-blind\" high school production of The Crucible. In one scene of \"Secret Santa\", Kenneth has multiple arrangements of multicultural holiday decorations in his desk page, which includes a portrait of U.S. President Barack Obama \"for the Muslims.\" Jack promises actor Larry Wilcox an appearance on the reality show Dancing with the Stars, if he visits Liz, until she tells him that the show airs on ABC. When Danny figures out sarcasm, he turns to the camera and says, \"That went well.\" This is the same thing that Rick Mercer does in every episode of the Canadian sitcom Made in Canada. \\n Reception \\n According to the Nielsen ratings system, \"Secret Santa\" was watched by households in its original American broadcast. It earned a 3.5 rating/9 share in the demographic, the season high in the rating. This means that it was seen by 3.5% of all 18- to 49-year-olds, and 9% of all 18- to 49-year-olds watching television at the time of the broadcast. ABC had an all-repeat evening on December 10, 2009, which helped increase numbers for the other networks. The night this episode broadcast, it was immediately preceded by an episode of The NBC the same title. Critical reception of the episode was not entirely favorable. Nathan Rabin of The A.V. Club noted a general decline in the show\\\\\\'s quality in the fourth season, and after a return to form in its previous episode, \"Dealbreakers Talk Show #0001\", he found \"Secret Santa\" disappointing, and gave it a grade \"It was cute and nicely plotted\", he wrote \"but it felt a little rote and familiar.\" IGN contributor Robert Canning was more positively inclined. He appreciated Julianne Moore\\\\\\'s appearance, but he found that some of the story lines, \"though sprinkled with funny moments, were more successful as sweet tales made for the holiday.\" Bob Sassone of AOL\\\\\\'s TV Squad was glad to see Cheyenne Jackson\\\\\\'s Danny back on 30 Rock, and noted that the plots concerning Jack and Nancy and Kenneth and the TGS writers, respectively, were \"home runs\". He liked that Tina Fey\\\\\\'s character Liz \"was more of a supporting player\" in \"Secret Santa\". Sassone also enjoyed Moore\\\\\\'s appearance on the show, commenting that she was \"wicked good\" as Jack\\\\\\'s new love interest. Entertainment Weekly\\\\\\'s Margaret Lyons wrote that this episode \"had some awesome Liz/Jack moments, a nice little storyline for Pete and Danny, and the invention of a whole new pizza-loving religion.\" Meredith Blake, writing for the Los Angeles Times, found that television Christmas episodes generally tended to bring \"an awkward shift in tone: All of a sudden, everyone\\\\\\'s being nice to each other.\" She also complained about the invented holiday, which she found to be an overused of Christmas programming: \"See also: \\\\\\'Chrismukkah\\\\\\' or \\\\\\'Festivus.\\\\\\'\" Also, television columnist Alan Sepinwall for The Star-Ledger found that the episode compared unfavorably with the preceding one, but still enjoyed the showcasing of several minor characters, and the \"tender holiday spirit\". What he appreciated most of all, however, was the Alec Moore angle. Mark Graham of New York magazine opined that the three plots in \"Secret Santa\" could not be considered as \"A-material\" for 30 Rock. Michael Anthony for TV Guide worried about the kiss between Jack and Nancy, as Nancy is married, and experiencing marital troubles. \"The Nancy kiss kind of troubles me; is Jack going to become the \\\\\\'other woman?\\\\\\'\"\\'b\\' \\n Sceptridium multifidum \\n Rarity \\n This species is rare in Europe.

Rates information  was updated every 5 minutes. Popular exchange directions at that time were   WebMoney and E-gold. In 2018, they are Qiwi, Bitcoin and Perfect Money. The project is based on a metamediary model, i.e. helping a deal to take place between a seller and a buyer via providing information and offering relevant services, whilst not taking a direct participation in the deal. One of the peculiarities is that there is no advertising on all the resources. Administration takes care of selecting exchangers after full check of their reputation on the Internet and various metrics (for instance, certificates and accounts in payment systems). According to the majority of financial periodicals, BestChange is number 1 in CIS countries among similar monitorings judging by the number of reviews and client traffic. Today monitoring has the leading position in the market of searching for exchanges e-currencies. Today there are as many as 400 active exchangers in the monitoring. The speed of updating exchange rates has increased by several times and now around 45 thousands of active directions are updated once every seconds. \\n In Russia \\n 39 Russian online-exchangers and monitoring BestChange were blocked on the basis of St. Petersburg court ruling in May 2017. In February 2018 the court cancelled the blocking.\\'b\\' \\n Rolando Uy \\n Rolando \"Klarex\" A. Uy (born July 5, 1954) is a Filipino politician.

Benaldo.\\'b\" \\n Free-bass system \\n History \\n By the year 1900, the Stradella bass system had principally reached its current construction with 120 buttons over 6 rows. However, while that setup worked well for major and minor music accompanied by many chords, the performer would only have access to about a single octave of notes while playing - two with a timely shift of registers. The problem was solved in the early 1900s by adding three rows of chromatically ordered single notes next to the standard bass. In 1900 in Moscow Russian master Bakanov made a garmon with piano keyboards for both right and left hands. From 1906 the brothers Kiselevs\\' factory in Tula began to produce bayans with the three-row free-bass left keyboard. In the United States, the virtuoso John Serry Sr. designed and built a working model of a Free-bass system to assist in the performance of both classical and symphonic jazz compositions in 1940. It incorporated dual key boards for the soloists\\' left hand based upon two sets of reeds which were tuned in octaves. This provided the soloist with a total range of tones which exceeded three and one half octaves. The dual keyboard design is illustrated below and was accessed through the use of a switch mechanism to provide independent access for the performers thumb onto Keyboard #2 and the performer\\'s remaining fingers onto Keyboard #1.

An orchestra was put together, touring Germany to introduce the new concept. The company also supplied sheet music for this new type of accordion. Although these were reportedly popular, it was not until later when the instrument became more widespread. In Northern Europe, free-bass accordionist Mogens Ellegaard helped popularize the instrument and inspire compositions for it. In an interview he describes how the free-bass accordion was still practically non-existent in his childhood (born 1935), but how composers in his native Denmark began to write works for him since 1958. In 1968 he arranged the manufacture of accordions with nothing but free-bass layouts to accommodate newcomers, as free-bass accordions would otherwise always include standard bass. In some Russian, Canadian and European music conservatoires, free bass accordion is considered a serious instrument for study and there is now a large modern repertoire for it. Free bass accordion is taught at the undergraduate and post-graduate levels at the National Autonomous University of Mexico in Mexico City. In the United States, free bass instruments are much less well known despite attempts to popularize them by Palmer and Hughes and the Giulietti Accordion Company in the 1960s and 1970s. During this period several American accordionists demonstrated the unique orchestral sound of the instrument through live performances as well as by composing original works which featured the instrument. Included among this group was John Serry, Sr. whose Concerto For Free Bass Accordion was completed during the 1960s. (See Accordion music genres)\"b\\' \\n Andrianjaka Razakatsitakatrandriana \\n Reign \\n Andrianjakatsitakatrandriana married twice during his life: first, Ravololontsimitovy of the Andriantsimitoviaminandriandehibe clan, and second, Rafoloarivo of the Andriamanjakatokana clan. He had four sons and six daughters. His younger brother, Andrianjakanavalondambo, lived in Alasora during Andrianjakatsitakatrandriana\\\\\\'s reign. As king, Andrianjakatsitakatrandriana soon showed himself to be stubborn and lacking in common sense. Several years into his rule, popular dissatisfaction was widespread. A widely respected political adviser and elder of the noble class named Andriamampandry took it upon himself to examine both brothers and rally the people to support a change in leadership. Andriamampandry visited the king and requested something to eat, but Andrianjakatsitakatrandriana claimed not to have anything available to share on that day. Before leaving, Andriamampandry asked the king, \"How many hearts do you have?\", to which the king replied that he had only one heart. Andriamampandry then visited prince Andrianjakanavalondambo, who acknowledged that it should normally be the king\\\\\\'s right to enjoy the honor of showing hospitality to Andriamampandry, but offered to share his meal with the elder nonetheless. Afterward, Andriamampandry asked the prince how many hearts he had, to which the prince replied that he had two. Three versions of the events that followed Andriamampandry\\\\\\'s initial assessment of the two brothers were recorded in the mid-19th century Tantara ny Andriana eto Madagasikara, the first documenting of Merina oral history. In the first version, Andriamampandry rallied the public in a speech that retold his experience with the brothers and explained in figurative terms the selfishness of men with one heart and the generosity and empathy of men with two hearts. Andriamampandry then left the gathering and was halfway to the royal palace when he was stopped by a man named Andriamanalina who offered to express the people\\\\\\'s concerns to the king. The two traveled to the palace and Andriamanalina requested an audience. When an attendant asked his reason for wishing to see the king, Andriamanalina responded with a lengthy condemnation and then departed. Afterward the king discussed Andriamanalina\\\\\\'s diatribe with Andriamampandry, who explained that the people were dissatisfied with him and advised him to leave the palace. The king departed, and at the same time the prince left Alasora to travel to his brother\\\\\\'s palace.  The first version of the story relates that during the king\\\\\\'s absence Andriamampandry burned down the village at Andohalo, just outside the palace walls. The king returned having been universally lambasted, to find Andohalo burned and his younger brother occupying the palace under a new name - Andriamasinavalona - given to him by Andriamampandry. Andrianjakatsitakatrandriana fled to the coastal Kingdom of Boina, where he enticed a number of Sakalava soldiers to fight with him to retake the palace. The soldiers had not expected such a long journey, however, and abandoned Andrianjakatsitakatrandriana before reaching the highlands. Defeated, Andrianjakatsitakatrandriana returned to the capital and offered his submission to his younger brother. Andriamasinavalona sent him to live out his days in the village of Ankadimbahoaka. The variations on this narrative are fundamentally similar. A second version recounts that the prince described himself as having \"three hearts, two hearts, and one heart\" (rather than just two hearts), and explains that Andriamampandry tricked the king into leaving the palace by instructing him to journey to a distant location to sacrifice a zebu to the ancestors. In the third version, a primary role is given to the sampy (royal idol) named Kelimalaza, to which the success of Andriamasinavalona\\\\\\'s coup is attributed. \\n Death \\n Andrianjakatsitakatrandriana died in Ankadimbahoaka and was buried in Ambohimanatrika. The former site of the burned village at Andohalo was renamed Ambohimanoro (\"Burned Hill\") and the site was forbidden to all future sovereigns of Imerina.\\'b\" \\n Hasmonean High School \\n History \\n The school was founded by the late Rabbi Dr. Solomon Schonfeld in 1944 as Hasmonean Grammar School. Schonfeld rescued thousands of Jews from the Holocaust and pioneered Jewish day school education in England. Schonfeld considered there to be a need for an Orthodox Jewish school in North West London, which, despite having high numbers of Orthodox Jews, did not have a religious school to cater for them. Many Jews had reached Great Britain from different parts of Nazi-occupied Europe, most of them settling in London. Since Orthodox Judaism places great emphasis on the upbringing of children, he saw a need for a school where the children could be educated in an Orthodox Jewish environment. The school became a voluntary aided Local Authority School in 1957. In September 1975, the girls moved to the present purpose-built Page Street site in Mill Hill. In 1984, voluntary aided status was extended to the girls\\' school, and the two sections joined as one to become a five-form-entry School. In April 1994, the school became grant maintained, but returned to Voluntary Aided Status in September 1999, following the abolition of grant-maintained schools. In March 2008 Hasmonean was singled out as one of the faith schools in the news for its procedure of demanding contributions from parents as a condition of entry. The school converted to academy status in October 2011. The school has established a Beis Hamedrash programme for fifth and sixth form boys (Years and a Midrasha programme for sixth form girls. \\n Location \\n Originally, the school was situated in The Drive in Golders Green until 1947. In that year, the boys\\' school moved to Holders Hill Road, where it has remained until the present day. Until 1975, the girls\\' school was accommodated in a two large houses in Parson Street, Hendon, when it was relocated to Page Street. \\n Transport \\n As of September 2011, the bus route 240 serves the boys site of the school, with access to Golders Green, Edgware and Mill Hill Broadway Stations for all students. At Mill Hill Broadway there is access to the 221 Bus, 113 Bus, 251 Bus. The closest underground station is Mill Hill East. \\n Governing body \\n Soon after its opening, the school became part of the Jewish Secondary Schools Movement (JSSM). Under the terms of the JSSM scheme, the trustees of the school must be appointed by the rabbis of certain synagogues, namely, the Adath Yisroel, the Golders Green Beth Hamedrash Congregation and the Hendon Adath Yisroel. The trustees in turn appoint the Foundation Governors, who together with the Headteacher, two LEA appointed Governors, three parent-elected Governors, two teacher-elected Governors and the Staff Governor form the Governing Body. The current chairmen of governors are Mr Gary Swabel (MAT), Mr Yossi Halberstadt (Boys) and Mr Steven Blumgart (Girls). \\n Future \\n Hasmonean High school has two campuses, one for boys and a separate one for girls, which are over a mile apart. The two campuses share leadership teams and teaching staff, but, in accordance with Hasmonean\\'s ethos, the educational accommodation, external spaces and play areas are separate. In 2016, Hasmonean proposed moving both the and campuses onto one secured site.  Each campus would sit on its own site and have separate entrances, facilities and play areas. The land identified at this stage is the land next to, and including, the current campus on Page Street. Each campus would also have its own security team.\"b\\' \\n Kannamangalam (Alappuzha) \\n Demographics \\n In the 2001 India census, Kannamangalam had a population of 23173 with 11071 males and 12102 females.\\'b\\' \\n Champawat Tiger \\n The Champawat Tiger was a Bengal tigress responsible for an estimated 436 deaths in Nepal and the Kumaon area of India, during the last years of the 19th century and the first years of the 20th century. Her attacks have been listed in the Guinness Book of World Records as the highest number of fatalities from a tiger. She was shot in 1907 by Jim Corbett. \\n History \\n According to Peter Byrne, professional hunter and author from Nepal, the tiger began her attacks in a Rupal village in western Nepal, Himalayas. Hunters were sent in to kill the tiger, but she managed to evade them. Eventually, the Nepalese Army was called in. Despite failing to capture or kill the tiger, soldiers organised a massive beat and managed to force the tiger to abandon her territory and drive her across the border (river Sarda) into India, where she continued her killing activities in the Kumaon District. The tiger would adjust her hunting strategy so as to best hunt and evade humans; traveling great distances between villages (as much as 20 miles in a day) in her new territory both to claim new victims and evade pursuers; her behavior becoming more like a Siberian tiger in her habits and creating a larger territory to encompass multiple villages in the Kumaon area, with Champawat being close to the center of her territory. Most of her victims consisted of young women and children, as they were the ones most at risk thanks to their habit of going into the forest to collect resources for feeding livestock, collecting firewood, and for crafting. All her kills happened during the daylight (as Corbett writes, he is not aware of a single case of a man-eating tiger killing a human during the night). Life across the region grew paralyzed, with men often refusing to leave their huts for work after hearing the tiger\\\\\\'s roars from the forest. In 1907, the tiger was killed by British hunter Jim Corbett. The tiger had killed a 16-year-old girl, Premka Devi, in the village of Fungar, near to the town of Champawat, and left a trail of blood, which Corbett followed. After nearly getting ambushed by the tiger while investigating the remains of its victim and scaring her off with two shots from his rifle, Corbett had to abandon the hunt, deciding to use villagers and to organize a beat the next day in the Champa River gorge.  With the help of the tehsildar of Champawat, the beat was organized with about 300 villagers, and the next day, about noon, Corbett shot the tigress dead. Corbett\\\\\\'s first shots hit the tigress in the chest and shoulder, and his last shot, made with the tehsildar\\\\\\'s rifle to keep it from charging him after he ran out of bullets, hit the cat in the foot, causing it to collapse from him.   A postmortem on the tigress showed the upper and lower canine teeth on the right side of her mouth were broken, the upper one in half, the lower one right down to the bone. This injury, a result of an old gunshot, according to Corbett, probably prevented her from hunting her natural prey, and hence, she started to hunt humans. Further examinations made by Corbett during his hunt for the tiger indicated that the cat was in healthy condition physically (other than her teeth), and that she was between 10 and 12 years old. \\n Champawat town \\n In Champawat, near the Chataar Bridge and on the way to Lohaghat, there is a \"cement board\" marking the place where the tigress was finally brought down. The details about the Champawat Tigress and how she was brought down can be found in the book Maneaters of Kumaon (1944), written by Corbett himself. \\n Killing site \\n The information about the first victim of the tigress, as well as the photos of the overhanging rock at the Champa River, where the tigress was killed, can be seen in the book Behind Jim Corbett\\\\\\'s Stories which is freely available on the internet. \\n In popular culture \\n The video game Guild Wars 2, features a tiger-themed legendary weapon and accompanying quest series named \"Chuka and Champawat\".\\'b\\' \\n Le Tas Invisible \\n Declaration of Guiding Principles \\n Le Tas Invisible is mainly an inquiry into the persistent existence of secretive interventions, presented on the margins; about invisibility in public and alternative spaces; and on questions of stealthy collective actions, where only simultaneity and modalities ensure the conceptual unity of the actions in the geographical fragmentation of the collective. The essential point that seems to emerge from the participatory and furtive experience of these meetings is based on its intersubjective, nourishing and exploratory aspects that rally at each subsequent meeting. Le Tas Invisible tends to make room for the freedom of, by and for art in our lives. Invisible, 2016 \\n History \\n The collective, Le Tas Invisible, was founded in 2013 following a performance art workshop led by Alastair MacLennan, the Scottish-born performance artist who help found Bbeyond in Belfast (Northern Ireland). This particular workshop, held at Inter/Le Lieu, centre en art actuel (Quebec City, Quebec, Canada), was attended by those who would be Le Tas Invisibles founding members. The collective\\\\\\'s first Performance Monthly meetings or Performance Monthlies (PMs), which since its inception advocates for the inclusion of all the participants in \"accidental\" and \"fleeting\" (from the French, \"furtive\") performances within the public spaces (or alternative spaces) on the basis of voluntary, free association and anonymity, took place from 2013 to 2014 in the City of Quebec. In 2014, a first \"tas invisible\" (invisible gathering) was held in Ottawa. Moreover, in 2014, a first geographically-dispersed tas invisible took place simultaneously in two cities Quebec City (Quebec) and Grande Prairie (Alberta). As such, the collective opts for multi-site, simultaneous manifestations despite differences of time and space. In 2014, Le Tas Invisible travelled to Northern Ireland in order to participate in a festival at Belfast presented by the Bbeyond collective, which is internationally acclaimed for its contribution to innovate performance art. The collective\\\\\\'s activities have also included projects such as an artist\\\\\\'s residency at Flax International, during which they performed in Derry. In 2016, Le Tas Invisible was dormant for six months. Thereafter, the collective resumed its activities in full force. New branches of the collective have sprouted in many cities in the province of Quebec, such as in and Rimouski in 2016, and in 2017, in In 2014, a \"tas\" in Ottawa/Gatineau become active, multiplying its members and manifestation from 2016 onwards. Occasionally, the collective performs by including international contributors from countries such as Germany and Spain, or members perform in other cities (for example in Bratislava, Madrid, Nice, Tel Aviv). They need no formal invitation to perform and manifest themselves through action. Therefore, those who act are indeed Le Tas. On September 22, 2016, the various splinters groups of Le Tas Invisible acted in synchronicity with an international gathering of performance art called the Rencontre internationale d\\\\\\'art performance (RiAP), organized by Inter/Le Lieu. As a discrete manifestation presented outside of the official festival, the global event was called Equinox to Equinox: Same Difference. Initiated by the collective Bbeyond, to which Le Tas Invisible was invited to collaborate, the manifestation included more than 37 groups of performers performing simultaneously throughout the world. On September 22, 2017, for exceptional reasons, Le Tas Invisible decided to out its own invisibility for a day in support of the Day of Public Action for Freedom and Democracy. Initiated by the performance artist and cultural activist called Chumpon Apisuk (Thailand), following Equinox to Equinox, this day was an extension of the symposium program called Being in Public: Encounters Outer Place and Inner Space, again organized by Bbeyond in Northern Ireland, where Le Tas Invisible contributed. During the autumn Equinox, the collective manifested itself throughout Canada through manifestation of art in action in public spaces in Ottawa (Ontario), Montreal (Quebec), Quebec City Rimouski (Quebec), Hermit Lake (Alberta), Edmonton (Alberta), Lethbridge (Alberta), and Victoria, (British Columbia) simultaneously. A letter signed by Bbeyond and the 37 performance collectives scattered across the globe participating in the equinoctial event (including Le Tas Invisible) is circulating from country to country and will be provided to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights principal religious representatives of the world in order to declare the autumn Equinox a Day for Freedom and Democracy in public.\\'b\" \\n Apophlegmatism \\n Apophlegmatisms, in pre-modern medicine, were medications chewed in order to draw away phlegm and humours from the head and brain. Such treatments were called apophlegmatic. Of this kind, tobacco was considered excellent, except for the damage it does to teeth. Sage was said to have almost the same virtues without the same defects. \\n Etymology \\n The word comes from the Greek and (\\'inflammation, heat\\').\"b\\' \\n Hollis Seaplane Base \\n Facilities and aircraft \\n Hollis Clark Bay Seaplane Base has one seaplane landing area designated E/W with a water surface measuring 10,000 by 500 feet (3,048 x It formerly had two landing areas, a NW/SE waterway measuring 6,000 by 500 feet (1,829 x and an E/W waterway that was 4,500 by 500 feet (1,372 x For the 12-month period ending December 31, 2006, the airport had 450 aircraft operations, an average of 37 per month: 89% air taxi and 11% general aviation.\\'b\" \\n Abram Gaar House and Farm \\n Restoration \\n In the 1970s, Joanna Hill Mikesell, granddaughter of the builder and his wife Agnes restored the home which had remained in her family since it was built. Most of the original fabric of the house remains intact and historic windows, front porch fittings, and interior elements were found in storage on the property and returned to the house during restoration. She established the non-profit Agnes and Abram Gaar Foundation to assume ownership of the house, its contents and a few outbuildings. The Foundation operates the house as a historic house museum. \\n Collection \\n The home holds a significant collection of Victorian decorative arts including nearly all the original Eastlake style furnishings, some of which were purchased from the 1876 Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia.   Original bills of sale for furniture from Mitchell and Rammelsberg Furniture Company in Cincinnati, Ohio, are also part of the collection.  in addition to the house and furnishings, the Foundation\\'s collection holds a number of archival items relating to the history of the Gaar-Scott company and the Gaar family.\"b\\' \\n Lear Corporation \\n History \\n Lear Corporation was launched as American Metal Products in 1917 in Detroit, Michigan. At the time of its founding it was engaged in the manufacture of tubular, welded and stamped assemblies for the aircraft and automobile industries. Lear grew during the 1980s and 1990s through a series of acquisitions. The company sought to become a supplier of complete interior automotive systems, that is, a supplier of seating, electrical, flooring, interior trim, instrument panels, etc., to original equipment manufacturing (OEM) auto companies. On March 16, 1999, Lear announced it would acquire United Technologies Automotive, a subsidiary of United Technologies Corporation that produced dashboards, electrical distribution systems, motors and air-flow parts, interior door panels and switches, for $2.3 billion.  Lear announced on May 4, 1999, that it had completed the acquisition. On April 5, 2004, Lear announced it would pay $220 million for Wuppertal, Germany-based Grote & Hartmann, a maker of electrical components. On July 6, 2004, Lear announced it had completed the transaction. As of late 2005, most OEM auto companies had indicated that they no longer wanted to purchase total interiors from any one company. As this was Lear\\\\\\'s primary purpose in assembling those three divisions, and the Interior Systems Division was not profitable, the company began seeking to get rid of this division. In early 2007, Lear Corporation completed the transfer of substantially all of its former North American Interior Systems Division to International Automotive Components Group (IAC), a joint venture of Lear, WL Ross & Co., and Franklin Mutual Advisers. The deal involved 26 manufacturing plants and two Chinese joint ventures. Lear also contributed $27 million in cash for a 25 percent interest in IAC and warrants for an additional 7 percent. Also in 2007, Lear\\\\\\'s board of directors agreed to a $2.3 billion takeover offer from American Real Estate Partners, an affiliate of financier Carl Icahn, subject to shareholder approval. Lear has said it will continue to talk to other interested parties, however, Icahn would receive a $100 million fee should another offer be accepted. The deal was later voted down by shareholders. On July 2, 2009 Bloomberg News reported that Lear Corp. planned to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy after reaching an agreement with representatives of secured lenders and bondholders. On November 9, 2009, Lear announced it had emerged from bankruptcy. On August 10, 2011, Lear announced that senior vice president and chief financial officer Matt Simoncini had been elected chief executive officer and president, effective September 1, 2011. In 2012, Automotive News awarded Lear a Premier Automotive Suppliers\\\\\\' Contribution to Excellence (PACE) Award for innovation, technological advancement and business performance for its Solid State Smart Junction Box (S3JB), noting Lear\\\\\\'s \"S3JB junction box has 1) integrated solid state fuse technology to eliminate relays, 2) created a new package that no longer has to be accessible from the driver compartment which decreases nuisance calls and lowers electrical device warranty returns, 3) created and installed a smart software logic with detailed diagnostics to permit a \\\\\\'fail safe operation,\\\\\\' and 4) designed a single state board design with patented thermal aspects that permits multiple system and device connections and various configurations to ease manufacturing processes.\" Lear acquired automotive and specialty fabrics company Guilford Mills for $257 million in May 2012. In addition to automotive fabric applications, Guilford produces fabrics for markets including water filtration, window covering, performance apparel, medical and other industrial applications. In August 2014, it was announced that Lear Corp would acquire automotive leather supplier Eagle Ottawa LLC for a fee of $850 million. In May 2015 the company announced that it would open a new automotive plant in Gostivar, Macedonia, in the summer of 2015. This was to be Lear\\\\\\'s first facility in Macedonia. In August 2015 the company acquired the intellectual property and engineering team of Autonet Mobile. Autonet Mobile was a developer of connected car solutions using cellular, WiFi, bluetooth and cloud connected solutions. In November 2015 the company acquired Arada Systems. Arada Systems was a technology company specializing in vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2V and V2I, together V2X) communication systems. They developed hardware and software solutions for V2X utilizing their expertise in dedicated short range communication (DSRC) and other wired and wireless technologies such as CAN and GPS. In February 2017 it was announced that Lear Corp signed a definitive agreement to acquire Grupo Antolin\\\\\\'s automotive seating business. The transaction was valued at million on a cash and debt free basis. Lear Corp funded the transaction with cash on hand.\\'b\\' \\n Galway Advertiser \\n The Galway Advertiser is a free newspaper distributed throughout Galway city and county on Thursdays. It was the first of the regional newspapers under the \"Advertiser\" banner, which now also includes publications based in Athlone and Mayo, as well as advertiser.ie.\\'b\\' \\n Shraddha Nigam \\n Career \\n Shraddha Nigam\\\\\\'s TV debut was the serial Choodiyan. The Times of India wrote that her role as the female lead in Krishna Arjun \"stole hearts\". In 2010 she portrayed a rape victim in a crime serial. At that time Nigam began to focus on her fashion design line. In 2012, she was offered a role opposite Anuj Saxena in a show produced by Bhairavi Raichura. \\n Personal life \\n Shraddha completed her education in Indore Madhya Pradesh and studied Fashion Designing from Symbiosis International University in Pune.

In 2012, December Shraddha got married to Mayank Anand; the couple own a fashion line together since 2011 and have plans for joint furniture design and interior design.\\'b\\' \\n Julia Roberts (QVC presenter) \\n Dancer \\n Roberts started her career as a cabaret dancer, supporting Cannon and Ball in a summer season in Guernsey, and then followed their act on to television. She supplemented this work with various supporting cast roles on TV including Citizen Smith and Doctor Who in 1979, Christmas pantomimes and dancing on cruise liners. She then took a job in a cabaret show in Hong Kong, dancing and singing. Roberts returned to the UK, and appeared in various commercials, including the Woolwich Building Society and Head & Shoulders shampoo. In 1980, she was approached by a group called The Main Event to sing on their Eurovision Song contest entry, \"I\\\\\\'m Gonna Do My Best To Please You\" - which came last. The ensemble included Cheryl Baker, who won the following year as part of Bucks Fizz. \\n Television \\n Wishing to undertake more television, she appeared as a hostess on The Price is Right with Leslie Crowther. After two series she had her first child, Daniel, and then worked on the \\\\\\'Hit Squad\\\\\\' on Beadle\\\\\\'s About, before having her second child, Sophie. After the birth of her first child, Roberts and her husband Chris were living in South London, when Croydon Cable started cabling the local streets. Looking to get into television presentation, she sent in an audition tape based on her time at the 1989 Motorshow at Olympia for Vauxhall Motors. Roberts got the job undertaking general reporting duties, developing her role by presenting on her own \\\\\\'magazine-style\\\\\\' program on the station. It was during this period that she began presenting the channel\\\\\\'s shows on Crystal Palace F.C., which resulted in her great enthusiasm for the football club. Roberts is a season ticket holder, has in the past written a column in Palace News and been interviewed for Sky TV, and has presented half-time slots on the giant screen in the stadium, promoting club merchandise. Asked by her agent to apply for a new shopping channel in 1993, she presented a pilot slot on presenting her own mobile phone for 15 minutes, and a pencil for 5 minutes. Appearing on the channel\\\\\\'s opening sequences with co-presenter Jon Briggs, Roberts is one of two original cast members who have been with QVC since its launch in the UK in October 1993. Roberts was one of two judges, the other being Head of Presenters Mark West, who selected Craig Rowe as winner of QVC\\\\\\'s \\\\\\'Search for a Presenter\\\\\\'.\\'b\\' \\n Biddlesden \\n History \\n The village toponym is derived from the Old English for either \"house in a valley\" or \"Byttel\\\\\\'s valley\". In the Domesday Book of 1086 the village is recorded as Betesdene. In 1147 Ernald de Bosco founded the Cistercian Biddlesden Abbey. In 1315, the village was granted a temporary charter to hold a weekly market. When the abbey was seized on behalf of Henry VIII during the Dissolution of the Monasteries it was assessed to be earning in excess of annually in rents and tithes. Although the abbey continued after this time as living accommodation for those in favour with the monarch, the building was not maintained thoroughly and fell into disrepair. By the 18th century the abbey was in ruins and was finally demolished in 1727. The country house of Biddlesden Park was built on the same site. Within the parish of Biddlesden there was the hamlet of Evershaw.  In the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle at the time of King Edward the Confessor this settlement was listed as being in the possession of a \"certain bandy-legged man\". Evershaw\\\\\\'s toponym is derived from the Old English for \"boar wood\". The family names \"Evershaw\" and \"Eversaw\" are derived from this place. No trace of the hamlet remains today.\\'b\\' \\n Sir James Abercrombie, 1st Baronet \\n Sir James Abercrombie, 1st Baronet  (died 14 November 1724), of Edinburgh, was a British Army officer and Scottish Whig politician who sat in the House of Commons of Great Britain in 1710. Abercrombie was  the illegitimate son of James Hamilton, 4th Duke of Hamilton. He joined the Royal Scots as an ensign on 24 May 1696, and fought in the Battle of Blenheim in 1704 as Aide-de-Camp to George Douglas-Hamilton, 1st Earl of Orkney. He became brevet major in 1706 and captain on 31 May 1707. He was created baronet on 21 May 1709.  He subsequently served as a captain and lieutenant-colonel in the Coldstream Guards from 1710 to 1711. Abercrombie was returned unopposed as Member of Parliament (MP) for Dysart Burghs at a by-election on 16 January 1710 and held the seat until the dissolution of parliament  on 21 September 1710. He chose not to stand for re-election, and his successor as the member for Dysart Burghs, James Oswald, was elected unopposed at the 1710 British general election. Abercrombie became lieutenant-colonel on 20 March 1711 and brevet colonel on 1 November 1711. On 24 October 1712, he became Town Major (Lieutenant-Governor) of Dunkirk and as such, oversaw the evacuation of French forces and the installation of an allied garrison, holding the post for the rest of his life. He was commissioner for inspecting the demolition of Dunkirk fortifications from 1713  to 1716,  accumulating extensive arrears of pay and allowance. He spent some time chasing what he was owed, and had to sell his regiment to make ends meet. Abercrombie was probably unmarried and died without surviving male issue at his home in Charing Cross on 14 November 1724. The baronetcy became extinct on his death.\\'b\\' \\n Music of Grand Theft Auto V \\n The music for the 2013 action-adventure video game Grand Theft Auto V, developed by Rockstar North and published by Rockstar Games, was composed by The Alchemist, Oh No and Tangerine Dream in collaboration with Woody Jackson. The game is the first entry in the Grand Theft Auto series to make use of an original score. In collaboration with each other, the musicians produced over twenty hours of music which scores the game\\\\\\'s missions. Some of the works produced by the musicians throughout the game\\\\\\'s development influenced some of the in-game missions and sparked inspiration for further score development. Grand Theft Auto V also has an in-game radio that can tune into sixteen stations playing more than 441 tracks of licensed music, as well as two talk radio stations. The composers of the score wanted it to accompany the licensed music, as opposed to detracting from it. The game\\\\\\'s music has been released on three official soundtracks: The Music of Grand Theft Auto V, released alongside the initial launch of the game, consists of three volumes comprising the score, and selections from the in-game radio; The Cinematographic Score GTA 5, an electronic album released in March 2014, comprises tracks composed and produced by Tangerine Dream founder Edgar Froese; and Welcome to Los Santos, released with the Microsoft Windows version of the game, features songs from the in-game radio station \"The Lab\", produced by The Alchemist and Oh No. Critical reception to the soundtracks was positive, as reviewers felt that the music connected appropriately with the gameplay. \\n Radio station music \\n Since the game\\\\\\'s location is modelled on Southern California, the developers attempted to create an accurate representation of Californian music. Production of the soundtrack also consisted of licensing music for the radio stations, and selecting a DJ that matches the genre of music the station hosts. The soundtrack consists of a wide variety of radio stations that play different genres of music, including reggae, hip hop, pop and country. The game also features an original and dynamic score composed by Tangerine Dream, Woody Jackson, Alchemist and Oh No which plays out in several selective missions. Selected tracks from the score were later released on The Music of Grand Theft Auto V. In September 2014, it was announced that new songs would be added to some of the radio stations in the next-gen releases of the game. In developing the radio stations, the development team sought to reinforce the game\\\\\\'s recreation of California by licensing tracks they felt appropriately echoed a \"Cali feel\". On the inclusion of the pop station Non-Stop-Pop FM, music supervisor Ivan Pavlovich noted \"the first time you get off an airplane in L.A. and you hear the radio and the pop just seeps out... We wanted that. It really connects you to the world\". He felt that music licensing for the game involved a greater discernment than in Grand Theft Auto IV, as the music in Grand Theft Auto V played a greater role in building a Californian atmosphere. \"It reflects the environment in which the game is set\", he explained. Initially, the team planned to license over 900 tracks for the radio, but over time they refined the total number of tracks to 241. The tracks are shared between eighteen stations, and the radio also includes two talk-back stations. Some of the tracks were written specifically for the game; for example, rapper and producer Flying Lotus hosts the station FlyLo FM which includes original work he composed for the game. As Pavlovich noted, for each of the radio stations, over time the team would develop an understanding of where the station\\\\\\'s music was going and then select a DJ to host the station. Each station\\\\\\'s DJ was selected with the mindset that they would match the genre of music the station hosts; for example, in developing Los Santos Rock Radio the team licensed classic rock tracks, and thus Kenny Loggins became a fitting choice for the station\\\\\\'s DJ.\\'b\\' \\n Bellmont, Illinois \\n Geography \\n Bellmont is located at (38.384799, -87.909496). According to the 2010 census, Bellmont has a total area of 0.32 square miles all land.  The village is connected to nearby Albion and Mount Carmel by Illinois Route 15.\\'b\\' \\n The Burns and the Bees \\n Plot \\n Mr. Burns attends the annual Billionaires\\\\\\' Retreat, where he wins the fictional Austin Celtics pro basketball team in a poker game against the Rich Texan. After witnessing the antics of Mark Cuban at a Dallas Mavericks game, Burns tries to win over Springfield basketball fans with his own antics. Burns fails miserably, and decides to build a luxurious sports arena. Meanwhile, Jimbo, Dolph, and Kearney dare Bart to prank the second graders by hitting a beehive with his slingshot. Lisa discovers, however, the bees that should be in the hive are dead. Groundskeeper Willie explains the bees are dying all over Springfield by loss of habitat, thus contracting a fatal disease. Lisa seeks help from Homer (who at first was unwilling to save the bees until Lisa informs him that the bees make honey and, if they died, there will be no more honey) and Professor Frink who has an uninfected queen bee sting Lisa releasing pheromones which attracts many uninfected bees, which form a bee beard. After trying to keep the bees in the Simpson home, Lisa and Marge find an abandoned greenhouse for the bees to live in. However, the site of the greenhouse is exactly where Mr. Burns plans to construct his new arena. Lisa attempts to convince the town to save the bee population, but despite her logical protest that they always get into trouble when they ignore her advice, she fails when Burns informs everyone about the amazing features of his arena and threatens to trade the Excitement\\\\\\'s recent draft pick and fan favorite, Alaskan native and Eskimo Muk Mu. Lisa becomes depressed that the bee population is slowly dying. Homer and Moe attempt to help save the bees by mating a queen bee from Lisa\\\\\\'s hive with Moe\\\\\\'s Africanized bees to create a hybrid bee species strong enough to survive anywhere. On the night of the grand opening of Burns\\\\\\' sports arena, Homer takes Lisa to the top of a hill and shows her the hive containing the hybrid bees. When Homer accidentally releases them, the bees attack Burns\\\\\\' new arena which resembles a bee hive. In the end, the arena is legally declared a bee sanctuary, enabling the bees to survive. At the next billionaires\\\\\\' retreat, Mr. Burns reveals how much the bees cost him. After it is discovered that he is four million dollars short of a billion he is kicked out of the retreat and into the millionaires\\\\\\' camp. Much to his horror, these millionaires got rich thanks to their low-class businesses, such as a minor-league hockey team. \\n Production \\n The episode was written by Stephanie Gillis and directed by Mark Kirkland. Billionaires Mark Cuban and Jeff Bezos and sportscaster Marv Albert guest star as themselves. The episode marks a second use of the Christmas-themed opening, first seen in \"Kill Gil, Volumes I & II\". \\n Cultural references \\n Lisa\\\\\\'s subplot refers to the worldwide disappearance of bees known as Colony Collapse Disorder. In a scene where Homer imagines a future without honey, a small green robot resembling WALL-E from the 2008 film WALL-E, gives him a bottle of honey and then turns Homer into a cube. The bee tombstone that set Jerry Seinfeld a reference to the 2007 film Bee Movie where Seinfeld played as the voice of Barry. The Billionaires\\\\\\' Retreat is the parody of the Bohemian Club. In the opening sequence, Mr. Burns appears to be Ebenezer Scrooge with Smithers as Jacob Marley from A Christmas Carol. The statue of Mr. Burns outside his new basketball arena is based on the Nike, Inc. \"Jumpman\" logo featuring Michael Jordan. Just before Burns is thrown out of the Billionaires\\\\\\' retreat, he asks Mark Cuban if he can let him \"off the hook, for old times\\\\\\' sake\" and Cuban refuses, referring to the scene in the 1972 film The Godfather in which Salvatore Tessio is led away to be executed after being revealed as a traitor. The Billionaires play Quidditch, as it is depicted in the Harry Potter film series, and use the paintings Mona Lisa by Leonardo da Vinci, Whistler\\\\\\'s Mother by James Abbott McNeill Whistler and The Scream by Edvard Munch as target practice. The songs featured in the episode include \"Hip Hop Hooray\" by Naughty by Nature during Mr. Burns\\\\\\' attempt to be more like Mark Cuban, and \"Sea of Love\" as performed by The Honeydrippers, which Homer and Moe play to their bees. Scott Joplin\\\\\\'s \"Maple Leaf Rag\" is also played in the episode. \\n Reception \\n In its original airing, the episode garnered 6.19 million viewers. The episode received mixed reviews from critics.  Robert Canning of IGN gave the episode 7/10 and said that with an episode like this \"I just don\\\\\\'t laugh as much as I would have liked\".  Steve Heisler of The A.V. Club gave the episode a grade of B and said that episode was \"okay\", but \"boring\".  Erich Asperschlager of TV Verdict wrote: \"Part of me knows that the only way to enjoy the modern incarnation of The Simpsons is to stop expecting its stories to make sense. [The episode is] not straightforward at all. like sometime after the tenth season, The Simpsons writers started using Mad Libs to generate story ideas. In fact, got a sneaking suspicion the only reason this episode exists is because someone came up with the title \\\\\\'The Burns and the Bees\\\\\\' and just had to make it work.\"  Harry Shearer received a nomination for a Primetime Emmy Award for Emmy Award for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance for his role as Mr. Burns, Smithers, Lenny and Dr. Hibbert in this episode, but lost to fellow Simpsons cast member Dan Castellaneta.  Stephanie Gillis was nominated for a Writers Guild of America Award in the Animation category in 2010 for writing the episode. The Simpsons was the only show to be nominated in the category, with the other nominated episodes being \"Take My Life, Please\", \"Eeny Teeny Maya Moe\", \"Gone Maggie Gone\" and \"Wedding for Disaster\". The winner, \"Wedding for Disaster,\" was announced on February 20, 2010.\\'b\\' \\n Babella crassicostata \\n Distribution \\n This marine species occurs in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of Vietnam.\\'b\\' \\n Project X (web serial) \\n Plot \\n Project X is subtitled \"The True Story of Power Plant 67\" and supposedly tells of the events that led to the destruction of the Mt.

In the first elimination round, Jessica B., Amy, Simone, Rochelle, Jamie, Donna, Natalie, and Rana Lyn were eliminated by text message. Lynette and Madeline were eliminated after being called down to the pool. Megan, Cara, and Vita were called down to the pool but kept in the competition. Camilla, Stacy, Cara, and Brittany won a suitability challenge and were immune from elimination in the second elimination round. In the second elimination round, Vita, Callie, Mya, and Payten were eliminated by text message. Lauren, Carina, and Megan were called down to the pool, at which time Lauren was kept in the competition and Megan quit. Carina would have been eliminated but was kept in due to Megan\\'s departure. \\n Episode 3 \\n When the episode began, a box was brought in. It contained files about each woman\\'s personal details. In this episode\\'s challenge Food Network chef Tyler Florence divided the women into groups to Michael, Rob, or Jojo their favorite food. Jojo\\'s mom cried since no one chose to prepare her son\\'s favorite food (catlase and grape leaves). The chef asked Julie to make his food, and she did. Some of the women elected to prepare their own personal favorite recipes, as Meghan and Amanda cooked a stuffed pepper dish instead; Erica made a chicken casserole. After the women prepared the meals, the sons and chef judged each of the meals. The winners were Amanda, Meghan, Julie, and Erica, who were exempted from having their files opened in this episode. After this round, the mothers opened the files. Lorraine chose Michelle. Esther chose Lauren in order to see how good she was. Khalood chose Brittany. Although they went on dates with Michael in that episode, Carina and Jessica C. were both eliminated. Stacey and Cara both received a no via text message, and Cara threw a tantrum upon her exit. The next elimination was to decide the fates of Nikki, Michelle, and Brittany, and Brittany was eliminated at the pool. \\n Episode 4 \\n The episode began with a specific focus on family holiday traditions. With the assistance of a priest and a rabbi, the women were given 2 hours to prepare either a Christmas morning or a Hanukkah party along the men and their mothers. Following the festivities, Erica and Michael had their first date, followed by Jojo and Misty. During her son\\'s date, Khalood demanded to the producers that she be taken to her son\\'s location. When she was taken by helicopter to his date, she was distraught when she caught the pair embracing. The next round of the series would continue in the U.S. Virgin Islands. The men would be allowed to select two women to accompany them, and their mothers would choose one. Rob first chose Camilla and then Amanda, however, Amanda declined the invitation from Rob. Rob then picked Nikki to go with him. Esther picked Lauren to attend as well.  Michael selected Erica and Meghan to go with him, and specifically rejected Michelle. Lorraine chose Amanda as her pick. Jojo refused Misty citing that she did not respect his mother, and he chose both Julie and Mindy to come with him. However, his mother, feeling that none of the women were an appropriate match for him, tore up the remaining ticket. The two remaining girls, Liz and Maisha, were therefore also eliminated. \\n Episode 5 \\n In the U.S. Virgin Islands, the men had individual dates with one of the women chosen to go. Rob and Camilla, Michael and Amanda, and Jojo and Mindy had a date. For the eliminations, the mothers were allowed to select the women they felt was most compatible with their son. In return, that woman would be both spared from elimination and allowed to accompany the man on the final date. Esther again chose Lauren, Lorraine selected Erica, and Khalood denied both Mindy and Julie the final date. Finally, the men were forced to eliminate one girl. Nikki, Meghan, and Julie were asked to leave. \\n Episode 6 \\n In the season finale (which also became the series finale), the men went on a final date. Having selected neither Julie or Mindy to attend the final date, Khalood accompanied her son instead. Rob and Lauren shared another date, and during her date with Michael, Erica revealed to both him and Lorraine her status as the 2008 Penthouse Pet of the Year. The men would then have to make a final decision, and the winning pair would receive an extended vacation. For the final selection, Rob chose Lauren over Camilla. Michael picked Amanda, and Jojo picked Mindy over his mother. In the epilogue, Rob left after one day, and without Lauren. Khalood refused counseling, and that following the expiration of her contract, Erica visited Lorraine in Florida.\"b\" \\n Michel-Eustache-Gaspard-Alain Chartier de \\n Family \\n Born in the Quebec City in 1748, he was the son of Michel Chartier de 1st Marquis de and his wife Louise-Madeleine daughter of Gaspard-Joseph Chaussegros de engineer-in-chief of New France. He was one of a distinguished group of first cousins that included The Hon. Antoine Juchereau Duchesnay, Chaussegros, Vicomte de Mme Jacques-Philippe Saveuse de Beaujeu, The Hon. Chaussegros de and The Hon. Chaussegros de He was the brother-in-law of The Hon. Pierre-Amable de Bonne. De inherited the title Marquis de in 1798, but he never used it. This choice was probably to keep political favor with the new rulers of Canada as his father had been in constant and open opposition to British rule for which in 1784 he had been awarded the Marquisate. \\n Military life \\n Aged eleven, he served as a cadet during the Siege of Quebec in 1759. The following year he was gazetted second ensign with the French Army when they were stationed in Montreal before accompanying his father to France. In France, he resumed his studies with the thought of joining the French cavalry, but following the Treaty of Paris (1763) and the consequent loss of his father\\'s land in America, he returned to Quebec and was commissioned as a military surveyor in 1768. From 1770, his father had incurred many debts, so with the financial help of his father\\'s friend Tarieu de La he kept the seigneuries of Lotbiniere, Vaudreuil, Rigaud and Rigaud de Vaudreuil (which he sold in 1772 to his uncle) in the family by purchasing them from his father. Although only in his early twenties, through his immense properties, prestigious name and family connections he was now one of the most influential Canadian seigneurs. Unlike his father, he immediately recognised the importance of working with the British and he therefore adapted himself to the circumstances in which he found himself. After the American invasion of Montreal in 1775, he was one of the first Canadian seigneurs to offer his services to the Governor Guy Carleton, 1st Baron Dorchester. He helped to defend Fort St Johns (later Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu) against the Americans, but was captured and taken prisoner by them and removed to Albany, New York. It was during this time that he developed a strong friendship with William Bingham, whose only son later went on to marry one of his daughters. He was released in 1776, and on returning to Montreal in 1777, having won Carleton\\'s trust, he was appointed a Justice of the Peace. He continued to serve in the Canadian militia and in 1794 became Lieutenant-Colonel of the Vaudreuil Battalion of Militia. In 1803, he was made a full Colonel, finally retiring from the militia in 1818. He died at his home in Montreal, 1822. \\n Language debate, 1793 \\n In the Legislative Assembly of Lower Canada, was elected Speaker in the 1st Parliament of Lower Canada, having entered with his brother-in-law, Pierre-Amable de Bonne, for the riding of York which took in his seigneuries of Vaudreuil and Rigaud, Quebec. Politically he is best remembered for his role in sanctioning the use of French in the Parliamentary records. The moment is captured in a painting by Charles Huot which hangs above the Chair in the present-day National Assembly of Quebec. In this speech, recorded in the Quebec Gazette on 31 January 1793, he asked for French and English to be given equal recognition in the House, Since the majority of our constituents are placed in a special situation, we are obliged to depart from the ordinary rules and forced to ask for the use of a language which is not that of the empire; but, being as fair to others as we hope they will be to us, we should not want our language eventually to banish that of His other subjects.\"b\\' \\n T.

The couple subsequently divorced. In 1971, while identifying as an Orthodox Jew (though she previously and later identified as Reform Jewish), she published an article entitled \"The Jew Who Wasn\\\\\\'t There: Halacha and the Jewish Woman,\"  in Davka magazine; according to historian Paula Hyman, this article was a trailblazer in analyzing the status of Jewish women using feminism. In 1972, she published an article entitled \"Tum\\\\\\'ah and Toharah: Ends and Beginnings.\" In this article she argued that the ritual immersion of a niddah (a menstruating woman) in a mikveh did not \"oppress or denigrate women.\" Instead, she argued, such immersion constituted a ritual reenactment of \"death and resurrection\" that was actually \"equally accessible to men and women.\" However, she eventually renounced this position.  In her essay \"In Your Blood, Live: Re-visions of a Theology of Purity\", published in Tikkun in 1993, she wrote \"purity and impurity do not constitute a cycle through which all members of society pass, as I argued in my [1972] essay. Instead, impurity and purity define a class system in which the most impure people are women.\" In 1983, she published an essay in Moment entitled \"I\\\\\\'ve Had Nothing Yet, So I Can\\\\\\'t Take More,\" in which she criticized rabbinic tradition for making women \"a focus of the sacred rather than active participants in its processes,\" and declared that being a Jewish woman \"is very much like being Alice at the Hatter\\\\\\'s tea party. We did not participate in making the rules, nor were we there at the beginning of the party.\" In 1992, she began a women\\\\\\'s Talmud class in her home, teaching the text (in its original Hebrew and Aramaic). This created the first rigorous Talmud study opportunity for lay women outside of New York and Israel. Adler received a PhD in Religion from the University of Southern California in 1997; her doctoral dissertation was titled \"Justice and Peace Have Kissed: A Feminist Theology of Judaism.\"  She is the author of many articles that have appeared in Blackwell\\\\\\'s Companion to Feminist Philosophy, Beginning Anew: A Woman\\\\\\'s Companion to the High Holy Days, Contemporary Jewish Religious Thought, Lifecycles, The Jewish Condition, and On Being a Jewish Feminist. She was awarded the 2000 Tuttleman Foundation Book Award of Gratz College and the 1999 National Jewish Book Award for Jewish Thought by the Jewish Book Council for her book  Engendering Judaism: An Inclusive Theology and Ethics; this was the first time the National Jewish Book Award for Jewish Thought was ever awarded to a female theologian. Among the book\\\\\\'s contributions to Jewish thoughts was the creation of a new ritual, brit ahuvim, to replace the traditional erusin marriage ceremony, which Adler viewed as not according with feminist ideals of equality between the sexes. Originally a Reform Jew, but converting to Orthodox Judaism in her teens, Adler made her final spiritual home in the Reform movement. On May 13, 2012, she was ordained as a rabbi by the Reform seminary Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion in Los Angeles. In 2013, Adler became the first person to hold the Rabbi David Ellenson Chair in Jewish Religious Thought at Hebrew Union College.\\'b\\' \\n Specific inhalation challenge \\n The specific inhalation challenge (SIC) is a diagnosis tool to assess airway responsiveness to \"sensitizing\" substances as opposed to nonspecific stimuli such as pharmacological agents (i.e. histamine, methacholine), cold air and exercise. Subjects are exposed to a suspected occupational agent in a controlled way under close supervision in a hospital laboratory. The specific inhalation challenges has been considered as the gold standard in confirming the diagnosis of occupational asthma. \\n Methods \\n One of the steps of SIC is to perform a challenge with the suspected asthmagen. Then, is subsequently measured using another device and compared to a baseline. A positive response is usually a decrease in baseline of 15 to 20 percent. \\n Realistic method \\n The realistic method was developed in the 1970s. The patient enters a sealed chamber and is exposed to the suspected agent in a controlled, non-work, test environment. The asthmagen can be water-soluble and nebulized. If the agent is non-soluble, the patient tips the agent from one tray to another in an attempt to mimic the work environment. This method has the advantage of being able to assess, albeit highly subjectively,ocular and nasal symptoms as well as a reduction in There are, however, disadvantages to the method. First, SIC is currently only conducted in specialty facilities because the facilities and equipment are rare and expensive. Second, the realistic method may exposed the patient to huge concentrations of particles, resulting in unduly severe asthma attacks. Alternately, the agent can be delivered using the recently developed closed-circuit technique. \\n Closed-circuit method \\n This test requires the patient to breathe aerosols of the suspected agent (asthmagen) through an oro-facial mask or mouth piece. These asthmagens are aerosolized using closed-circuit chambers, and the quantities and concentrations administered being minute and extremely stable minimize the risk of exaggerated responses.\\'b\\' \\n Edgar S. Brightman \\n Early life and education \\n Brightman was born on September 20, 1884 in Holbrook, Massachusetts, and was the only child of a Methodist pastor. He studied at Brown University from which he graduated with a BA degree in 1907, and then with an MA degree in 1908. He then proceeded to Boston University where he was awarded the Bachelor of Sacred Theology degree in 1910, followed by a PhD in 1912. He undertook further studies in Italy at the University of Berlin and Marburg University between 1901 and 1910. While at Brown, Brightman became a brother of the Kappa Sigma Fraternity. He was ordained a Methodist minister in 1912. \\n Career \\n Brightman was a professional philosopher who taught the subject at Nebraska Wesleyan University between 1912 and 1915. He then took up a post as lecturer in ethics and religion at the Wesleyan University in Connecticut from 1915 to 1919. Finally, he moved to Boston University in 1919 and taught philosophy there until he died on February 25, 1953. From 1925 to 1953 he occupied the Borden Parker Bowne chair of Philosophy. One of his earliest publications reflected the findings of higher criticism in Old Testament studies concerning the identification of sub-sources and sub-documents within the first six books of the Bible (the Hexateuch). The Documentary Hypothesis that Brightman drew upon had developed in Nineteenth Century German Biblical studies and had received their definitive form in the writings of Julius Wellhausen. Wellhausen, and those who built on his theories, argued that the first five books of the Bible (the Pentateuch) were a composite creation drawing on four original sources and edited into their final form in the fourth century BC. These conclusions ran counter to the traditional Jewish and Christian position that Moses received the Pentateuch from God, with little if any further modification. Brightman was attacked for his pro-Wellhausian views by conservative and fundamentalist Methodists, and blacklisted. In his involvement with the Methodist Church in America, Brightman joined the Methodist Federation for Social Action. He also supported conscientious objectors in war, was a member of the American Civil Liberties Union, and also the Committee on Peace through Justice. \\n Philosophical stance \\n Brightman\\\\\\'s philosophical views were influenced by the thought of Borden Parker Bowne  Bowne, who was a Methodist philosopher, emphasized the importance of personality and self-image, and encapsulated his ideas in the expression \"transcendent empiricism\".  By this Bowne meant that there was an existent reality beyond mere human sensory perceptions.  He held to the importance of intuition in understanding reality, and upheld the role of human free will.  In many ways Bowne\\\\\\'s work on personality anticipated some of the views of Sigmund Freud, and even Albert Einstein\\\\\\'s findings on the relativity of time and space.  Bowne\\\\\\'s emphasis on personality led to his philosophical views being known by the term personalism. Brightman was an advocate of Bowne\\\\\\'s position on personality, and those who gathered around both Bowne\\\\\\'s and Brightman\\\\\\'s writings became known as a movement called Boston personalism.  In Brightman\\\\\\'s system of thought the human self is the dominant metaphysical reality.  His philosophical method in argument is known as rational empiricism. In addition to building on Bowne\\\\\\'s position, Brightman is credited with developing a metaphysical view in the philosophy of religion called finitistic theism.  For Brightman God is a self-limited being whose good will though perfect is constrained by God\\\\\\'s own nature.  There is a dynamic relationship between God and the world that grows and develops, or is in process.  In Brightman\\\\\\'s thought God\\\\\\'s purposes intend good for the world, yet pain and suffering occur.  He did not argue for God having unlimited power over evil and suffering, but rather maintained that through the processes of the world and history evil will be overcome.  In effect, God uses the tragedies of the creation as instruments that enable the world to reach its final goal. Brightman\\\\\\'s views about the growing and developing relationship between God and the world has strong affinities with process philosophy as espoused by Alfred North Whitehead and Charles Hartshorne. Indeed, Hartshorne and Brightman maintained a lengthy and lively correspondence on these matters for a period of some twenty three years. Edgar Brightman was a teacher and mentor to Martin Luther King Jr. as King pursued his PhD at Boston University in the early 1950s. (Following Brightman\\\\\\'s death, Lotan Harold DeWolf, who had himself received his 1935 PhD in philosophy studying under Brightman, became King\\\\\\'s dissertation adviser and another significant influence on King\\\\\\'s theological and philosophical thinking.) Brightman\\\\\\'s influence is reflected in King\\\\\\'s philosophy of Nonviolence, most markedly in the sixth and most fundamental principle of King\\\\\\'s philosophy of Nonviolence, \"The arc of the Universe is long, but it bends toward justice.\"\\'b\\' \\n Stephen Storace \\n Stephen John Seymour Storace (4 April 1762 19 March 1796) was an English composer. His sister was the famous opera singer Nancy Storace. He was born in London in the Parish of St Marylebone to an English mother and Italian father.  Relatively little is known through direct records of his life, and most details are known second-hand through the memoirs of his contemporaries Michael Kelly, the actor John Bannister, and the oboist William Thomas Parke. \\n Early years and education in Italy \\n His father, Stefano Storace (b. Torre Annunziata, ca. 1725; d. London, ca. 1781), an Italian contrabassist and composer, taught him the violin so well that at ten years old he played successfully the most difficult music of the day.  The composer\\\\\\'s youth was spent entirely in the company of musicians, since his father (also a composer and arranger) was the Musical Director of Vauxhall Gardens. Mistrusting the quality of musical education available in England, Stefano Storace sent his son to Italy to study, at the Conservatorio di Sant\\\\\\' Onofrio, Naples. Stephen neglected his musical studies in Italy, and went on painting expeditions with Thomas Jones. His interest in art may not have been entirely extinguished, however unlike the works of any of his English contemporaries, the printed vocal scores of all his operas feature elaborate engravings of what are presumed to be the stage-designs, and it is suggested that these drawings were Stephen\\\\\\'s own work.  No other artist, at least, seems to have claimed credit for them.  Towards the end of their studies, Stephen and Nancy first made the acquaintance of Michael Kelly, whom they encountered by chance in Livorno.  Kelly was with English-speaking friends, and ventured an opinion (in English) as to whether the young person with Stephen was a boy or a girl.  \"The person is a she-animal\" retorted an offended Nancy in English as the first remark in what would be a lifelong friendship with both the Storaces. \\n Early professional employment in Vienna, \\n Stephen Storace returned to England sometime between the years of 1780 and 1782, most likely to settle his father\\\\\\'s affairs after his death in Naples, which probably happened around Nancy, accompanied by her mother, Elizabeth, went to Vienna in January 1783. Nancy entered into an arranged marriage, (most likely arranged by her mother) to the English violinist and composer, John Fisher, in March 1784. The marriage only lasted a few months. It is unclear how Stephen obtained his first commission to compose an Italian opera for the Viennese stage, but the commission was most likely obtained by Nancy sometime in the fall of 1784, with Stephen arriving in Vienna sometime in late December of that same year. Stephen produced his first opera, Gli Sposi malcontenti, at Vienna, on 1 June 1785. The premiere, however, was marred by further scandal involving his sister, who was singing the prima buffa role she collapsed on-stage in mid-aria, causing the performance to be abandoned. Nancy was pregnant during the premiere of I sposi malcontenti and gave birth to a baby girl a few weeks later. The child was given to a foundling home by Elizabeth Storace, who claimed that it belonged to Nancy\\\\\\'s estranged husband, John Fisher, who had been banished by the Emperor some months earlier for beating Nancy. Elizabeth Storace claimed that they did not care if the child lived or died. The child died in the foundling home a month after she was born. Nancy\\\\\\'s return to the stage four months later was marked by the performance of  Per la ricuperata salute di Ofelia, composed specially for the occasion by a trio of composers Mozart, Salieri, and the unknown \"Cornetti\" (which may have been a pen-name for Stephen, Salieri, or even perhaps Emperor Joseph II). This rare example of a Mozart-Salieri collaboration was just discovered in 2016. In Vienna the Storaces made the acquaintance of Mozart, in whose Le nozze di Figaro Nancy sang Susanna at the premiere, and Kelly sang Don Curzio. The \"English circle\" in Vienna also included the composer Thomas Attwood. In Vienna Stephen produced a second opera, Gli equivoci, founded on Shakespeare\\\\\\'s The Comedy of Errors. \\n The English Operas, \\n There is no clear explanation why the Storaces abandoned Vienna at the height of their success there. The reasons are suggested to be more personal than professional. Certainly the Emperor spoke of her with great admiration, even using her abilities as an arbitrary unit of currency \"I\\\\\\'d not give you a Storace for it!\". Quite possibly Nancy was under pressure from Elizabeth, who was not at all happy in Vienna, and wished to return to England with both of her children in tow. Nancy left Vienna in February 1787, along with her \"entourage\" of Michael Kelly, her brother, and Thomas Attwood. Buoyed-up by their success on the Viennese stage, the coach-party which left for London could not have imagined they would find themselves rejected and unwanted in London, where their names were quite forgotten after such a long absence. Stephen was remembered if at all as an infant prodigy violinist at Vauxhall Gardens, and found it very hard to secure paying work without the cherubic charm of youth behind him, and moreover as an unknown composer. Both Nancy and Stephen imagined they might find work at the King\\\\\\'s Theatre, which was at that time the home of the Royal Italian Opera, a troupe which enjoyed a Royal monopoly on the presentation of Italian opera, and in fact of any musical works which were through-composed without dialogue.  Kelly succeeded in getting a few roles there (on the basis of his wider professional experience, knowing roles the King\\\\\\'s Theatre already had in repertoire, and his legendary charm), but both Storaces found themselves excluded by the group of native Italian musicians already well-established there. Stephen too worked at the King\\\\\\'s Theatre as music director for some operas, including his own La Cameriera Astuta, before moving in 1789 to the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, which at this time was under the management of Richard Brinsley Sheridan.  Sheridan\\\\\\'s personal interest in the theatre had largely dried-up by this point in his career, and he was more interested in politics his theatrical interests were primarily financial, and he had established a successful format of lavish musical spectaculars, more remarkable for their visual than musical content.  To evade the Royal monopoly on opera at the King\\\\\\'s Theatre, Sheridan presented a mixture of Singspiel-type works specially written in English in the ballad-opera style, with \"English\\\\\\'d\" versions of popular operas playing in continental Europe in which he saw some commercial opportunity. Stephen Storace\\\\\\'s first job at Drury Lane was to make an \"English\" version of Dittersdorf\\\\\\'s German Singspiel Doktor und Apotheker, which appeared in English as Doctor & Apothecary in 1787 in Storace\\\\\\'s version.  The work of making \"English\" versions was not just a question of translation all complicated musical numbers (especially trios, quartets etc.) had to be \"cut\" to make them performable by English casts who were primarily pantomime comedians without any great musical talent.  This also meant transposition of some numbers, making a fresh English text, cutting whole numbers and replacing them with dialogue, and sometimes inserting new comic songs and \"patter-songs\" which the public greatly enjoyed. Stephen quickly established his credentials with Sheridan as a young man who could quickly and competently produce good results. He also had an impresario\\\\\\'s skill for judging what would make good box-office and bring in good receipts, and he took to adding famous numbers from the Vienna stage to \"spice-up\" works which needed it. Seeing that the repertoire of the King\\\\\\'s Theatre was still largely made-up of opera seria works about ancient gods or monarchs of antiquity, Storace spotted a niche in the market for the new \"romantic\" style of ghost-stories, gothic horror, and romance, and his first purpose-written work for Drury Lane employed all these elements.  The Haunted Tower (1789) was a box-office sensation, selling out for 50 nights in succession.  No little part of the success was the performance of Michael Kelly in the male lead role. Up to this time, high notes in the male parts in the theatre had been crooned falsetto by performers who were more actors than singers. Kelly\\\\\\'s aria to the ghost of the Haunted Tower \"Spirit of My Sainted Sire!\" included a top which he took in full voice in the Italian style, and proved such a success that at most performances it was encored in full. This aria outlived the rest of Storace\\\\\\'s output by decades, and was still being reprinted in parlour songbook anthologies for the amateur tenor a century later. However, The Haunted Tower still included \"borrowings\" from other composers on whose reputations tickets might be sold, and Sheridan remained adamant despite the success of the piece that he did not want Storace composing fresh work as a regular occurrence. Storace was put to work producing an \"English\" version of Gretry\\\\\\'s Richard, Coeur du Lion, with the unfortunate difficulty that John Bannister the famous tragedian was cast in the main role, and was tone-deaf. No amount of re-writing could get around the problem that Richard was supposed to sing his famous ballad so that Blondin would hear it outside the castle walls. As so often in Storace\\\\\\'s life, he was saved by his friends. Michael Kelly was now established as the audience\\\\\\'s favourite star after Bannister, and was given a Benefit Night in 1790 by tradition, he could choose whatever piece he believed would bring in the best receipts at the box-office. At this period a \"programme\" at Drury Lane would always be a double-bill a main work, and a one-act \"afterpiece\" which was usually a comedy. Kelly broke with tradition and risked his income by announcing to Sheridan\\\\\\'s disapproval that instead of a popular favourite, he would premiere a new afterpiece by Storace, called No song, no supper. No Song outsold even The Haunted Tower, and proved the best-selling show at Drury Lane for the following decade. Nancy had appeared as a Guest Artist in The Haunted Tower the success of No Song obliged Sheridan to take her \"onto the books\", and at last she secured a full-time engagement in Britain. It seems likely that Storace had been working on an \"English\" version of Vicente y Soler\\\\\\'s (known as Martini) comedy Una cosa rara an opera which had already been cited by Mozart in the final scene of Don Giovanni.  However, presumably at around the date of the No Song triumph, Storace abruptly discarded all of Martini\\\\\\'s music in Acts II and III, and had librettist James Cobb produce an entirely new libretto, creating another \"romantic\" hit situated in the midst of the Ottoman-Austrian war of a few years earlier, The Siege of Belgrade (1791).  From this point on Storace abandoned the ballad-opera style completely, and wrote the entire piece in the Mozartian \"Singspiel\" style.  The Siege is remarkable for the extended ensemble numbers such as the Act I Trio for the Seraskier, Lilla and Ghita, \"Your passions thus deceiving\" divided into allegro-andante-allegro sections.  Alive to what the public cheered most, Storace included a bravura coloratura aria for Mrs Crouch as the imprisoned Austrian hostage, Princess Catherine, \"My plaint in no-one pity moves\"; a warlike Act III aria for Kelly as the \"noble Turk\"; and an extraordinary \"Queen of the Night\"-style dramatic-coloratura Act III aria for Nancy, \"Domestic Peace\", with a string of double-octave fast upward scales to top c\\\\\\'\\\\\\' over French-horn fanfares that brought the house down. The printed vocal score not only includes one of the famous \"scenery\" engravings, but cast a glove down to the King\\\\\\'s Theatre avoiding all euphemism the work is clearly described as \"an Opera, in three acts\". The year 1792 saw Storace produce the boldest of his operatic projects, Dido, Queen of Carthage, with a libretto by Prince Hoare after Metastasio\\\\\\'s Didone abbandonata. This was the only all-sung opera Storace produced in English all his other works had spoken dialogue between the musical numbers.  His sister regarded it as Stephen\\\\\\'s finest work.  However, for whatever reason, the piece proved unpopular with the public, and was withdrawn after a short run.  The music was not thought worth printing commercially, with the result that not a note of this opera now survives, nor were any solo numbers from it printed separately. The Pirates, also produced in 1792, was partly adapted from Gli Equivoci, and is remarkable as affording one of the earliest instances of the introduction of a grand finale into an English opera. These works were followed by some less successful productions; but The Cherokee (1794) and The Three and the Deuce (1795) were very favourably received.  The Cherokee did not, unlike The Siege of Belgrade, attempt to add any \"exotic\" music for the Cherokee their \"War March\" is disappointingly four-square and tonal, but the \"War Whoop\" is an exciting number.  The work also introduced the public to the boy-treble star, \"Master Walsh\", whose coloratura talents must have been remarkable as his numbers are no less complex than Crouch\\\\\\'s or Nancy Storace\\\\\\'s.  He was to figure regularly in Storace\\\\\\'s works thereafter. Storace collaborated with Sheridan in bringing William Godwin\\\\\\'s controversial novel Caleb Williams to the stage.  In the light of the French Revolution, the work about a faithful servant whose life is ruined by a vicious master had gained considerable notoriety, and was produced under the title  The Iron Chest, first performed on 12 March 1796. Storace\\\\\\'s final work was Mahmoud, Prince of Persia, but he never saw the premiere. \\n Death \\n He caught cold at rehearsals for The Iron Chest, and died on 15 or 16 March 1796.  He is buried in Marylebone Parish Church with a monument by the celebrated sculptor Thomas Banks. Nancy Storace organised that the unfinished work was completed (Kelly claims to have had a hand in doing so, but it is more likely that he paid other hands to do it, since he freely admitted he could not read the bass clef.  Most likely the work was finished and orchestrated by the Orchestra Leader, John Shaw, who was Kelly\\\\\\'s collaborator on all his later projects).  The work was given as a Benefit Performance for Storace\\\\\\'s widow.  \"Mahmoud\" survives, but it is clear that the completed version was very makeshift. Storace is also known to have been involved in preparing musical spectaculars for isolated events.  It is intriguing to speculate what performances like The English Fleet in 1391 may have resembled, but no details survive.  He also wrote pieces \"to order\" for favourite performers at the Drury Lane Theatre, such as the musical comedian Richard \"Dicky\" Suett, for whom he wrote the musical farce My Grandmother.  Unfortunately we can only imagine the visual effect of numbers such as \"Dicky\\\\\\'s Walk\", which must have accompanied some on-stage buffoonery of a greatly amusing nature. \\n Legacy \\n Although Storace\\\\\\'s works were popular in their time, their failure to endure in performance is in part due to the financial caution of his employer, Sheridan.  A legendarily shrewd man with money, Sheridan refused to allow any copies of the Storace\\\\\\'s works to be circulated, for fear of pirate versions being performed from which no royalties would be paid.  In fact history shows that Sheridan\\\\\\'s best attempts failed, and pirated versions of Storace\\\\\\'s works were playing in New York by the end of the century. However, it is assumed that the carefully guarded scores and parts perished in the Drury Lane Theatre Fire.  Only one opera survives complete in score and parts No Song, No Supper (published in Musica Britannica editions, edited by Roger Fiske). The other works survive only in piano and voice vocal scores issued by Storace\\\\\\'s publishers, Longman & Broderip.  (A number of these scores were reprinted by Kalmus Edition in the 1970s in the USA, but all have been deleted and no details are available from Kalmus).  The surviving vocal scores have clearly been prepared by an expert hand, and are extensively \"cued\" with the orchestral parts in smaller notes it seems possible that Storace himself, or one of his closer assistants, must have prepared these vocal scores.   There are, to date, no commercially available recordings of any of Storace\\\\\\'s operas.  Storace is not known to have written any exclusively instrumental music, other than the overtures for his operas. The character of Storace\\\\\\'s music is preeminently English; but his early intercourse with Mozart gave him an immense advantage over his contemporaries in his management of the orchestra, while for the excellence of his writing for the voice he was no doubt indebted to the vocalisation of his sister Ann (Nancy) Storace.\\'b\\' \\n Shawn Atleo \\n Early years \\n Atleo was born in 1967 in Vancouver, British Columbia.

They lived at Fort Lewis, an antebellum mansion that became a state historic property but was destroyed by fire in the late 1940s. Payne attended prep school at Mercersburg Academy in Mercersburg, Pennsylvania, and then went to Roanoke College in Salem, Virginia. He then transferred to Columbia University in New York City in the fall of 1930. He studied drama at Columbia and voice at the Juilliard School. To support himself, he took on a variety of odd jobs, including wrestling as \"Alexei Petroff, the Savage of the Steppes\" and boxing as \"Tiger Jack Payne\". He returned to his home frequently for visits. In 1942, while visiting his family in Roanoke, Virginia, he agreed to take a small role in a community theatre production of \"The Man Who Came to Dinner\", at the Academy of Music on Salem Avenue. His character uttered only four words of dialogue, and was greeted by a burst of applause. \\n Stage Actor \\n In 1934, a talent scout for the Shubert theaters spotted Payne and gave him a job as a stock player. He appeared in road company productions of Rose Marie and The Student Prince at $40 a week. Payne toured with several Shubert Brothers shows, and frequently sang on New York-based radio programs.  On Broadway he appeared in the revue At Home Abroad alongside Eleanor Powell and Beatrice Lillie. He understudied for Reginald Gardiner and took over one night. He was seen by Fred Kohlmar of Sam Goldwyn\\\\\\'s company and was offered a movie contract. \\n Early Films \\n In 1936, he left New York for Hollywood. He tested for a role in Goldwyn\\\\\\'s Come and Get It but lost out to Frank Shields. His first role in Goldwyn\\\\\\'s Dodsworth (1936) presented him as an affable, handsome character actor. He had the male lead in Hats Off (1936), an independent \"B\" film. Goldwyn announced plans to co-star him with Miriam Hopkins in The Woman\\\\\\'s Touch, but the film appears to have not been made. In September 1936, it was announced Goldwyn would not sell half of Payne\\\\\\'s contract to Columbia, and that he might be the lead in Women Can Be Wrong. Payne was third billed in Fair Warning (1937), a \"B\" at Fox. He was the lead in a low budget film Love on Toast (1937). Payne was down the cast list for Paramount\\\\\\'s College Swing (1938). He then signed a contract with Warner Bros. \\n Warner Bros \\n At Warners, he had a notable break replacing Dick Powell, who turned down the role, in Garden of the Moon (1938). Warners used Payne as a sort of \"back up Dick Powell\". He was in Kid Nightingale (1939) and Wings of the Navy (1939). Payne supported Ann Sheridan in Indianapolis Speedway (1939) and starred in a short The Royal Rodeo (1939) and in Bs King of the Lumberjacks (1940) and Tear Gas Squad (1940). During this time he returned to Broadway to appear in Abe Lincoln in Illinois Payne was unhappy with his Warner Bros roles and asked for a release. \\n 20th Century Fox \\n Payne went over to 20th Century Fox where he appeared in Star Dust (1940). During filming, Darryl F. Zanuck offered him a long term contract. He supported Walter Brennan in Maryland (1940) and John Barrymore in The Great Profile (1940). Payne was the male lead in the enormously popular Tin Pan Alley (1940) with Alice Faye and Betty Grable. He romanced Faye again in The Great American Broadcast (1940) and  Week-End in Havana (1941) and  Sonja Henie in Sun Valley Serenade (1941). Fox gave him the chance to do drama in Remember the Day (1941), romancing Claudette Colbert. He was meant to be in Song of the Islands with Grable but when George Raft couldn\\\\\\'t get released from Warners Bros to play a marine in the hugely popular To the Shores of Tripoli (1942), Payne stepped in. The film, co starring Maureen O\\\\\\'Hara and Randolph Scott, was hugely popular. So too was Footlight Serenade (1942) with Grable and Victor Mature, Springtime in the Rockies (1942) with Grable, Iceland (1943) with Henie and especially Hello, Frisco, Hello (1943) with Faye. During World War II Payne served as a flight instructor in the United States Army Air Corps. He got his Honorable discharge in September 1944. He returned to work at Fox, who put him in The Dolly Sisters (1945) with Grable and June Haver, playing Harry Fox. It was one of Payne\\\\\\'s most successful films. Less popular was Wake Up and Dream (1946) with Haver. Payne was teamed with Maureen O\\\\\\'Hara in Sentimental Journey (1946), a big hit. He was third billed in The Razor\\\\\\'s Edge (1946) underneath Tyrone Power and Gene Tierney, Fox\\\\\\'s most prestigious film of 1946. Payne\\\\\\'s most familiar role may be his final film for Fox, that of attorney Fred Gailey in the classic holiday favorite Miracle on 34th Street (1947) with Natalie Wood, Maureen O\\\\\\'Hara and Edmund Gwenn. It was another box office success. He was meant to make another with O\\\\\\'Hara, Sitting Pretty (1948) . However, in October 1947 he got his release from the studio, despite the contract having another four years to run, which would have brought him $670,000. Payne claimed he was dissatisfied with the roles being offered him. Payne later said he had asked for his release every week for eight months before he got it. Film historian Jeanine Basinger later wrote that \"Fox thought of him [Payne] as a secondary Tyrone Power. They didn\\\\\\'t know how to use him.\" \\n Freelance Actor \\n After leaving Fox, Payne attempted to change his image and began playing tough-guy roles in Hollywood films noirs. He did two noirs at Universal, Larceny (1948), where he played the lead role, and The Saxon Charm (1948) with Robert Montgomery and Susan Hayward. He had the lead in The Crooked Way (1949) for United Artists. \\n Pine-Thomas Productions \\n Payne received an offer to star in a Western for Pine-Thomas Productions, a unit that operated out of Paramount Studios. El Paso (1949) was a box office success and Payne went on to make other films for the company including Captain China (1950), an adventure film; Tripoli (1950) set during the Barbary War; and The Eagle and the Hawk (1950), a Western. He signed a contract to make three more films for Pine Thomas He did Passage West (1951), another Western; and Crosswinds (1951), an adventure film; Caribbean Gold (1952), a pirate film; The Blazing Forest (1952), an adventure story; The Vanquished (1952), a Western. Payne shrewdly insisted that the films he appeared in be filmed in color and that the rights to the films revert to him after several years, making him wealthy when he rented them to television. In 1952 he said he got four times the fan mail he did at Fox. \"I make fewer pictures now but I make the kind I want to make.\" \\n Other Independent Producers \\n For Edward Small, he starred in Kansas City Confidential (1952), a noir; Payne owned 25% of the film. He later worked with Small on Raiders of the Seven Seas (1953), a pirate movie; and 99 River Street (1953), a noir. Payne did a series of Westerns: Silver Lode (1954), for Benedict Bogeaus; Rails Into Laramie (1955), for Universal; Santa Fe Passage (1955) and The Road to Denver (1955) at Republic, and Tennessee\\\\\\'s Partner (1955) for Bogeaus. In 1955, he paid a $1,000-a-month option for nine months on the Ian Fleming James Bond novel Moonraker (he eventually gave up the option when he learned he could not retain the rights for the entire book series). He returned to Pine Thomas for a noir, Hell\\\\\\'s Island (1956), then did Slightly Scarlet (1956) for Bogeaus. He made Hold Back the Night (1956) for Allied Artists and The Boss (1956) for United Artists, co-producing the latter. He did Rebel in Town (1956) and Hidden Fear (1957) for United Artists. He made one more Pine Thomas, Bailout at 43,000 (1957). In 1957 he optioned the rights for For the Life of Me, the memoir of a newspaper editor, but it was not made. \\n Television \\n Payne also starred as Vint Bonner, an educated, commonsense gunfighter, in The Restless Gun which aired on the National Broadcasting Company (NBC television network), on Monday evenings from 1957 to 1959, prior to Dale Robertson\\\\\\'s western series Tales of Wells Fargo. Dan Blocker, James Coburn, and Don Grady made their first substantive acting forays with Payne on The Restless Gun. On October 31, 1957, as The Restless Gun began airing, Payne guest-starred on The Ford Show, Starring Tennessee Ernie Ford. \\n Accident \\n In March 1961, Payne suffered extensive, life-threatening injuries when struck by a car in New York City. His recovery took two years. In his later roles, facial scars from the accident can be detected in close-ups; he chose not to have them removed. One of Payne\\\\\\'s first public appearances during this period was as a guest panelist on the popular CBS (Columbia Broadcasting System) Sunday night game show What\\\\\\'s My Line? In the December 3, 1961 episode, regular panelist Dorothy Kilgallen introduced Payne by saying, \"He\\\\\\'s been in the hospital after a very bad accident. So it\\\\\\'s good to see him fit as a fiddle and all in one piece.\" Regular panelist Bennett Cerf remarked, \"Good to see you here, John. Glad to see you beat that car on Madison Avenue that bumped into you.\" \\n Later career \\n Payne directed one of his last films, They Ran for Their Lives (1968), and again teamed up with Alice Faye in a 1974 revival of the musical Good News. He also starred in the Gunsmoke episode of \"Gentry\\\\\\'s Law\" in 1970. His final role was in 1975, when he co-starred with Peter Falk and Janet Leigh in the Columbo episode \"Forgotten Lady\". Later in life Payne, like former Daniel Boone-Davy Crockett series star Fess Parker, became wealthy through real estate investments in southern California. \\n Personal life \\n Payne was married to actress Anne Shirley from 1937 to 1942; they had a daughter, Julie Anne Payne.  After their divorce, Payne then married actress Gloria DeHaven in 1944; the union produced two children, Kathleen Hope Payne (b. 1945) and Thomas John Payne, before ending in a divorce in 1950.  Payne then married Alexandra Beryl \"Sandy\" Crowell Curtis in 1953, and remained with her until his death. He was the father-in-law of writer-director Robert Towne, who was married to his oldest daughter Julie until their divorce in 1982. His name was romantically linked to Eleanor Powell in 1936. Payne was a Republican and in October 1960 he was one of many conservative notables who drove in the Nixon-Lodge Bumper Sticker Motorcade in Los Angeles. \\n Death \\n Payne died in Malibu, California, of congestive heart failure on December 6, 1989, aged 77. His ashes were scattered into the Pacific Ocean. He has two stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, in motion pictures and television.\\'b\\' \\n George Thomason \\n George Thomason (died April 1666) was an English book collector. He is famous for assembling a collection of more than 22,000 books and pamphlets published during the time of the English Civil War and the interregnum. Thomason\\\\\\'s collection was formerly known as the \"King\\\\\\'s Pamphlets\" after King George III, but is now called the Thomason Collection of Civil War Tracts. \\n Biography \\n During the years just before the outbreak of war a great number of writings covering every phase of the questions in dispute between king and people were issued, and in 1641 Thomason began to collect these. Working diligently at his task for about twenty years, he possessed nearly 23,000 separate publications in 1662, and having arranged these in chronological order he had them bound in 1983 volumes. Thomason was concerned in Christopher Love\\\\\\'s plot in 1651. After many vicissitudes the collection was bought in 1761 from his descendants by George III, who presented it to the British Museum. In 1973, the museum transferred the Thomason Collection to the British Library.\\'b\\' \\n relations \\n History \\n First contact between Danes and Greeks dates back from the 4th century BC, when Greek merchant Pytheas went to Denmark. In 1863, the second King of Greece, George I, was of Danish descent, and his successors, the House of reigned over the country until 1973/1974. In 1992 opened the Danish Institute at Athens. \\n Recent bilateral visits \\n Queen Margrethe II of Denmark attended the Athens Olympic Games in 2004 and she paid an official visit to Greece in May 2006.\\'b\\' \\n Chhitauni \\n Geography \\n It is located at at an elevation of 81 m above MSL. \\n Places,Shops and Doctor \\n Chhitauni Bazar has the main village called Bulahwa bazar.

The following teams qualified for the playoffs: \\n Television \\n This was the eighth postseason under NBC Sports\\\\\\' current 10-year contract for American television rights to the NHL. All national coverage of games are being aired on either NBCSN, the NBC broadcast network, NHL Network, USA Network, or CNBC. During the first round, excluding games exclusively broadcast on NBC, the regional rights holders of each participating U.S. team will produce local telecasts of their respective games. For the third year, the first round national broadcasts were not blacked out on television in the markets of participating teams, and could co-exist with the local broadcasts (however, NBC-provided coverage was restricted in Pittsburgh and Las Vegas, where AT&T SportsNet held the regional rights to the Penguins and the Golden Knights respectively). In Canada, for the fifth postseason under Rogers Media\\\\\\'s current 12-year contract, coverage was broadcast in English by Sportsnet networks and CBC Television under the Hockey Night in Canada brand, and streamed on Sportsnet Now, CBCSports.ca (for games televised by CBC), or the subscription service Rogers NHL Live. In French, all games were aired by TVA Sports. Availability of the games were initially hampered by a major carriage dispute between Bell TV and the channel\\\\\\'s owner, Quebecor Media, over a proposed increase in carriage fees which Bell considered poorly-justified. On April 10, 2019, Quebecor pulled TVA Sports from Bell TV, despite it being illegal in Canada for channels to be pulled by their owners at a \"standstill\" in carriage negotiations. Bell publicly condemned the action, and stated it would offer the Sportsnet networks as a free preview to affected subscribers for the duration of the dispute, so that viewers still have access to the English-language broadcasts. On April 12, 2019, the channels were restored per a court injunction granted to Bell. The CRTC has since warned that any attempt to pull the channel again would result in a suspension of its license until access is restored. In the United States, NBC reported that the first round saw its highest cable viewership since 1994, and the highest overall ratings since 2012. Game seven of the Capitals/Hurricanes series was the most-watched first round game on cable since 2000.\\'b\\' \\n Elisha Hume Brewster \\n Education and career \\n Born in Worthington, Massachusetts, Brewster received a Bachelor of Laws from Boston University School of Law in 1896.

The origins of Islam in the country is linked with the development of Islam in the wider West Africa. Islam was first documented in Central Sudan by medieval Islamic historians and geographers such as Al-Bakri, Yaqut al-Hamawi and Al-Maqrizi and later works of Ibn Battuta and Ibn Khaldun offered more notes about Islam in West Africa. Islam grew in North-Est Nigeria, in particular the Kanem empire as a result of trade between Kanem and Northern African regions of Fezzan, Egypt and Cyrenaica in the eleventh century. Muslim merchants from the North sometimes remained in settlements along trade routes, this merchant class would later preach the message of Islam to their host communities. The first documented conversion of a traditional ruler was in the eleventh century, when Mai Ume Jilmi of Kanem was converted by a Muslim scholar whose descendants later held an hereditary title of Chief Imam of Kanem. Writings by Ahmad Fartua an Imam during the period of Idris Alooma provided glimpse of an active Islamic community in Bornu while religious archives showed Islam had been adopted as the religion of the majority of the leading figures in the Borno Empire during the reign of Mai (king) Idris Alooma although a large part of that country still adhered to traditional religions. Alooma furthered the cause of Islam in the country by introducing Islamic courts, establishing mosques, and setting up a hostel in Makkah, the Islamic pilgrimage destination, for Kanuris. In Hausaland, particularly Kano, Islam is noted to have penetrated the territory in the fourteenth century from West African traders who were converted by Tukulor Muslims from the Senegalese basin and Muslim traders from Mali Empire. Muhammed Rumfa (1463 - 1499) was the first ruler to convert to Islam in Hausaland. It had spread to the major cities of the northern part of the country by the 16th century, later moving into the countryside and towards the Middle Belt uplands. However, there are some claims for an earlier arrival. The Nigeria-born Muslim scholar Sheikh Dr. Abu-Abdullah Abdul-Fattah Adelabu has argued that Islam had reached Sub-Sahara Africa, including Nigeria, as early as the 1st century of Hijrah through Muslim traders and expeditions during the reign of the Arab conqueror, Uqba ibn al Nafia whose Islamic conquests under the Umayyad dynasty, during Muawiyah\\'s and Yazid\\'s time, spread all Northern Africa or the Maghrib Al-Arabi, which includes present-day Algeria, Tunisia, Libya and Morocco. \\n Fulani War \\n In the early 19th century, Islamic scholar Usman dan Fodio launched a jihad, which is called the Fulani War, against the Hausa Kingdoms of Northern Nigeria. He was victorious, and established the Fulani Empire with its capital at Sokoto. \\n Maitatsine \\n A fringe and heretical group, led by the cleric Mohammed Marwa Maitatsine, started in Kano in the late 1970s and operated throughout the 1980s. Maitatsine (since deceased) was from Cameroon, and claimed to have had divine revelations superseding those of the Prophet Muhammad. With their own mosques and a doctrine antagonistic to established Islamic and societal leadership, its main appeal was to marginal and poverty-stricken urban in-migrants, whose rejection by the more established urban groups fostered this religious opposition. These disaffected adherents ultimately lashed out at the more traditional mosques and congregations, resulting in violent outbreaks in several cities of the north. \\n Quranists \\n Non-sectarian Muslims who reject the authority of hadith, known as Quranists, Quraniyoon, or \\'Yan Kala Kato, are also present in Nigeria. \\'Yan Kala Kato is often mistaken for a militant group called Yan Tatsine (also known as Maitatsine), an unrelated group founded by Muhammadu Marwa. Marwa was killed in 1980. Marwa\\'s successor, Musa Makaniki, was arrested in 2004 and sentenced in 2006, but later released. And another leader of Yan Tatsine, Malam Badamasi, was killed in 2009. Notable Nigerian Quranists include Islamic scholars Mallam Saleh Idris Bello, Malam Isiyaka Salisu, and Nigerian High Court Judge Isa Othman. \\n Sharia law \\n In 2008, twelve states located in northern Nigeria had fully implemented Sharia law. The twelve states in northern Nigeria have populations where Muslims form the majority. In 2014, homosexual men were targeted by Hisbah, the religious police. According to a member of the Sharia Commission, homosexuals should be killed by stoning, hanging or pushing them from a high place. In Nigeria, federal law criminalizes homosexual behaviour, but states with Sharia law imposed the death penalty. \\n Influence on culture \\n Historically, Islam fostered trade relations between North Africa and West Africa. Arabic traders from Tiaret during the Rustamid dynasty were involved in commerce with Audoghast. This trade routes went further south into the Kanuri and Hausa states of Northern Nigeria. Sharia was also introduced into Northern Nigeria has Islam spread across the region. In addition to law and trade, Islam had some influence in spreading the choice of dressing, language and choice of names. Agbada dressing in West Africa is commonly associated with Muslims and Mallams, Iborun (neck covers) is worn by many Muslims in Southern Nigeria during prayers and crochet hats were once mostly worn by Muslims to had performed the pilgrimage. Some Hausa and Yoruba expressions and words are also influenced by Arabic, the language of the Koran. Assalam Alaykun is a familiar expression for greeting by Muslims and Allahu Akbar is used as a call to prayer. Names such as Mohammed, Ibrahim, Yunusa, Lamidi, Aliu and Suleiman are commonly given to Muslim children. \\n Traditional Islamic education \\n Before the 1950s, the most common educational path of Muslim children in Northern Nigeria was Koranic education taught by Mallams. Students converge in the compound of a mallam or at a Koranic boarding school where they recite the Koran and learn Islamic teachings. The teacher or Mallam as they are sometimes called in Nigeria was likely a graduate of a similar school and likely belongs to a sufi order. These teachers were well versed in Arabic and were influenced by the knowledge and traditions passed down from medieval Timbuktu and from other West African Islamic texts.  Traditional Islamic teaching was considered a duty to God and teachers sometimes depended on charity or patrons to make ends meet. Meanwhile,  students also assist teachers in raising funds through door-to-door solicitations. In the period preceding Nigeria\\'s independence, political leaders desired Western-trained graduates to fill positions in government. Subsequently, the introduction of a formal School of Arabic Studies in Kano to train Qadis and rise in Western education reduced the number of children attending the Koranic schools. In addition, Islamic studies was introduced into the primary and secondary school curriculum.  However, some parents still send their children to the traditional Koranic schools under the tutelage of a mallam. The students are provided shelter by their teacher. The pre-adolescents sometimes subsist through alms begging or house-help jobs, while those above fifteen learn a trade or do petty trading along with their Islamic studies. The studies can be rigorous, with students studying the Koran for fourteen hours per day until they reach a set level of maturity. These students, primarily from rural areas, are called transliteration of Al Muhajirun, the Arabic word for Nigeria. They are sometimes looked down upon by Western-educated Muslims who are uncomfortable with the alms begging lifestyle of many Almajiri. \\n Extremism \\n In Nigeria, Pew Research polled the views of Muslims on extremist groups. 45% favoured Hezbollah, 49% favoured Hamas and 49% favoured Al-Qaeda. Unlike Turkey, Egypt, Jordan and Indonesia, Nigeria was the only country where Muslims were positive towards Al-Qaeda.\"b\" \\n Drummer of Cortachy \\n The Drummer of Cortachy is the name given to a spirit who is thought to haunt Cortachy Castle. There are many interpretations of the story, but he is variously thought to portend the death of a member of the Ogilvy family, Earl of Airlie or the owners of Cortachy Castle. He is said to be nine foot tall and is occasionally accompanied by ghostly pipes. The legend can trace its roots back to at least the 19th century and the death of the 14th Earl of Airlie. He is said to play a tattoo when he appears. The ghost is thought to be the spirit of a drummer for the Carlisle family; who was thrown out of a window in the high tower of the castle after incurring the jealousy of the then Lord. However, some versions of the story say that the drummer was the messenger for a hated chieftain and in yet another version of the tale, he is the spirit of a drummer who deliberately failed to warn the castle of an impending attack. In all versions of the tale he was stuffed into his drum before his death. The most famous sighting of the drummer was in 1844, when the Lady Airlie (or in some versions, her guests) heard the noise. She would later write in a note on her deathbed that she \\'knew the drumming was for [her]\\'. The spirit is now thought to be dormant since in 1900 the Earl of Airlie died in the Boer War without a reported sighting.\"b\\' \\n Casa Amatller \\n Casa Amatller is a building in the Modernisme style in Barcelona, designed by Josep Puig i Cadafalch. Along with Casa and Casa it makes up the three most important buildings in Barcelona\\\\\\'s famous Illa de la (\"Block of Discord\"), noted for its unique modernist buildings. The building was originally designed as a residence for chocolatier Antoni Amatller and was constructed between 1898 and 1900.\\'b\\' \\n Gamious \\n History \\n Gamious was founded in 2011 by Pim and Jos Bouman. They created a platform called the \"Game Train\" to collaborate with other game developers. The Game Train enabled freelancing game developers to work with Gamious to create games. Gamious would publish and market the game, and share the revenue with the developers. Gamious had a database of over 400 people working on 21 projects. Gamious eventually dropped the Game Train as they felt that it was too much for them and gave back the titles to their respective owners. Some Game Train games were developed further, and became some of Gamious\\\\\\'s early released Briquid and iO.\\'b\\' \\n Dantron \\n Medical uses \\n In the USA, dantron is not used because it is considered to be a carcinogen. In the UK it is considered a possible carcinogen and so its licence is restricted to patients who already have a diagnosis of terminal cancer. It is mainly used in palliative care to counteract the constipating effects of opioids. Its  British Approved Name was danthron, but it has now been changed to \"dantron\", the recommended International Nonproprietary Name. Dantron can be administered orally, or can be administered rectally as an enema either in combination with other laxatives or alone. \\n Side effects \\n Dantron has the notable side-effect of causing red-colored urine.\\'b\\' \\n Dat Sexy Body \\n Background \\n Sasha, a deejay, had released a single entitled \"Kill The Bitch\" while she was in her teens which was commercially unsuccessful. Her debut studio album, Come Again was also a flop. The remix to \"Dat Sexy Body\", Sasha\\\\\\'s first commercially successful single, features the singer-songwriter Ivy Queen. As Ivy Queen\\\\\\'s fan base continued to grow, she attracted Sasha who invited her to record the song. According to Murray Elias of VP Records: \"Ivy Queen is kind of rough and Sasha has a more feminine, playful approach, so those two styles blend well, this could be a breakthrough record for Ivy Queen, where you see the Jamaican market embracing the vibe.\" \\n Composition \\n \"Dat Sexy Body\" was composed by Karen Chin, Martha Pesante, Ernesto Roberts and Anthony Kelly. Production was handled by Kelly, under his stage name Tony \"CD\" Kelly. Additional production was provided by Murray \"M Diddy\" Elias while Philip Smart served as recording engineer as well as Dave Hyman. A hip-hop remix produced by DJ Excel The Mixmaster NYC with Fatman Scoop was later recorded and released in 2004 as \"Coca Cola Shape\" while a remix with Ivy Queen was also included. \\n Chart performance \\n The song did moderately well in France peaking at #31 on its SNEP Singles chart. On the Billboard Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart, \"Dat Sexy Body\" debuted for the week of August 30, 2003. It peaked at #78 on the chart for the week of September 13, 2003. The song ended its reign on the chart for the issue week of November 1, 2003 after spending eight consecutive weeks on the chart. This is Ivy Queen\\\\\\'s first and only single to appear on the Billboard Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart, however she has had songs on the Billboard Hot 100 and Rhythmic Top 40.\\'b\\' \\n National Highway 548B (India) \\n Route \\n Mantha,  Deogoan Fata, Selu, Pathari, Sonpeth, Parali Vaijnath, Ambajogai, Renapurphata, Latur, Ausa, Omerga, Yenegur, Murum, Alur, Akkalkot, Nagasur, Bijapur.\\'b\\' \\n Bring It On Home (Sonny Boy Williamson II song) \\n Recording and release \\n Sonny Boy Williamson recorded the song on January 11, 1963 in Chicago. He alternates his vocal sections with harmonica phrases, accompanied by Matt \"Guitar\" Murphy on guitar, Milton Rector on bass guitar, Al Duncan on drums, and either Lafayette Leake or Billy Emerson on organ.  AllMusic reviewer Bill Janovitz describes Williamson\\\\\\'s harp playing as \"subdued\" and his vocal delivery as \"smooth\": \"The swinging music chugs like a train, a feeling it is supposed to evoke for the lyrics I done bought my ticket, I got my load  Conductor done hollered, \\\\\\'All, aboard\\\\\\'  Take my seat and ride way back  And watch this train move down the  I\\\\\\'m gonna bring it on home to you\" \"Bring It On Home\" was released three years later in early 1966, when it was included on the Chess Records Williamson compilation The Real Folk Blues. Chess subsidiary Checker Records also released it as a single, but it did not reach the record charts. \\n Copyright issue \\n Without songwriter Willie Dixon\\\\\\'s knowledge, Arc Music, the music publishing arm of Chess Records, brought a claim against Led Zeppelin for using \"Bring It On Home\" without its permission.  The group maintained that they copied parts of the song as an intentional tribute to Williamson, but resolved the matter with an undisclosed cash settlement.  For the 2003 live album How the West Was Won, the song was credited to Dixon alone, with the note \"Medley contains \\\\\\'Bring It On Back\\\\\\' (Jimmy Page/Robert Plant/John Paul Jones/John Bonham)\". On the 2014 Led Zeppelin II reissue, Dixon is listed as the sole songwriter.\\'b\\' \\n Proconsul \\n A proconsul was an official of ancient Rome who acted on behalf of a consul. A proconsul was typically a former consul. The term is also used in recent history for officials with delegated authority. In the Roman Republic, military command, or imperium, could be exercised constitutionally only by a consul. There were two consuls at a time, each elected to a one-year term. They could not normally serve two terms in a row. If a military campaign was in progress at the end of a consul\\\\\\'s term, the consul in command might be appointed as proconsul by the Senate when his term expired. This custom allowed for continuity of command despite the high turnover of consuls. In the Roman Empire, proconsul was a title held by a civil governor and did not imply military command. In modern times, various officials with notable delegated authority have been referred to as proconsuls. Studies of leadership typically divide leaders into policymakers and subordinate administrators. The proconsul occupies a position between these two categories. Max Weber classified leadership as traditional, rational-legal (bureaucratic), and charismatic. A proconsul could be both a rule-following bureaucrat and charismatic personality. The rise of bureaucracy and rapid communication has reduced the scope for proconsular freelancing. \\n Etymology \\n The Latin word is a shortened form of consule, meaning \"(one acting) for the consul.\" It appears on inscriptions beginning in 135 BC. Ancient historians describe Quintus Publilius Philo, the first proconsul, as consule for 326 BC. For later proconsuls, the same sources use the shortened form. \\n In leadership theory \\n Although \"proconsul\" is an official title only with respect to magistrates of ancient Rome, the word has also been applied to various British, U.S., and French officials. In the modern context, it is rarely a compliment. The terms satrap (from Persian) and viceroy (from French) are both used in a similar way. Despite the gulf between ancient and modern proconsuls, writer Carnes Lord has proposed a single definition to allow the phenomenon to be analyzed in the context of leadership theory: \"delegated political-military leadership that rises in the best case to statesmanship\". South African historian John Benyon defines a proconsul as a leader with \"semi-independent and extraordinary capacity to shape the periphery\" of an empire. Modern writing on leadership tends to stress the distinction between \"administration\" on the one hand and \"policy\" on the other. This emphasis can be traced to an essay by Woodrow Wilson written in the late 19th century. In earlier epochs, it was common for leaders to combine the two roles. Since this is no longer the case, specific terminology is required to describe such officials. In his classic study, Max Weber distinguished among three modes of legitimate governance: traditional, rational-legal, and charismatic. In the form of bureaucracy, the rational-legal mode is dominant in the modern world. But a modern proconsul may also resort to aristocratic, or charismatic, leadership. In the Roman Republic, a proconsul was typically a former consul and thus an experienced commander-in-chief. Having held the Republic\\\\\\'s highest office, he was a statesman as well as an administrator. Rome\\\\\\'s patrician class was prepared to exercise aristocratic leadership, both civil and military. Several factors are said to limit the scope of proconsular authority in modern times. Democracies put the military under civilian authority and tend to avoid policymaking by military leaders. Modern government emphasizes bureaucracy and rulemaking, while the Romans were aristocratic. Finally, modern communications allows for greater central control. Although transoceanic telegraph lines were laid by the mid-19th century, Lord describes the late 19th century as the heyday of British proconsular authority. Lord Curzon in India, Frederick Lugard in Nigeria, Cecil Rhodes in South Africa, and Cromer in Egypt all took imperial initiatives that London approved only reluctantly. As ruler of Japan and Korea after World War II, U.S. General Douglas MacArthur consciously modeled himself on a Roman aristocrat. The role of U.S. General David Petraeus and others in Iraq suggests a continued need for proconsular leadership, according to Lord. Modern technology makes communication easier than ever. But as email and Power Point presentations proliferate, clarity and intellectual discipline is lost. Another factor is that civilian policymakers, whether on the spot or in the metropole, may lack the skills needed to manage military forces. Yet proconsuls are at best an ad hoc solution to a reoccurring problem. Managing a large territory in occupation or conflict requires a range of skills and the ability to deal with various organizations. No one is trained as a proconsul and the available administrators have experience in at most one relevant agency or service. During the Vietnam War, the U.S. attempted to deal with this issue by creating an integrated civilian-military command structure called Civil Operations and Revolutionary Development Support (CORDS). \\n British Empire \\n British colonial officials sometimes referred to as proconsuls include Alfred Milner in South Africa, Lord Curzon in India, Lord Lugard in Nigeria, and Lord Kitchener in Egypt and Sudan. These leaders were able to take imperial initiatives even when the government in London was reluctant. Conservative and Unionist governments were notably more tolerant of such freelancing than Liberal governments were. These proconsuls ruled in the age of the transoceanic telegraph, so rapid communication did not end proconsular independence. \\n United States \\n Various American commanders and ambassadors have been referred to as proconsuls. Writer Carnes Lord discusses William Howard Taft in the Philippines Leonard Wood in Cuba; Lucius D. Clay in Germany; Douglas MacArthur in Korea; Edward Lansdale in Vietnam; Henry Cabot Lodge Jr., ambassador to Vietnam in Creighton Abrams, who commanded in the Vietnam War from 1968 to 1972; Ellsworth Butler, ambassador in Vietnam in William Colby and Ellsworth Bunker in Vietnam; Wesley Clark in Bosnia in Lewis Paul Bremer in Iraq in 2003; and David Petraeus in Iraq in and in Afghanistan in \\n Kentisbury \\n Kentisbury is a rural civil parish in North Devon, England, bordering the Exmoor National Park, consisting of three small hamlets, Patchole, Kentisbury Ford and Kentisbury, approximately 10 miles north east of Barnstaple. The population at the 2001 census was 266 people, increasing to 299 at the 2011 census. \\n Parish Church \\n The Church of England parish Church of Saint is part of the benefice of Shirwell. \\n Early history \\n There is evidence of an Iron Age enclosure on Kentisbury Down. Kentisbury is mentioned in the Domesday Book, shown as Chentesberia. \\n Local amenities \\n The nearest public house is the Old Station House Inn, which, as its name suggests, was opened in the Station House of the former Lynton & Barnstaple Railway following its closure in 1935. A project is in existence to re-open the railway as a tourist attraction. A school has existed in the village since 1876, the existing Primary School building dating from 1929.\\'b\\' \\n Celia Fiennes \\n Pioneering traveller \\n Fiennes never married. In 1691 she moved to London, where she had a married sister. She travelled around England on horseback between 1684 and about 1703, \"to regain my health by variety and change of aire and exercise\" (Journeys). At this time the idea of travel for its own sake was still novel, and Fiennes was exceptional as an enthusiastic woman traveller. Sometimes she travelled with relatives, but she made her \"Great Journey to Newcastle and Cornwall\" of 1698 accompanied only by one or two servants. Her travels continued intermittently until at least 1712 and took her through most of England. \\n Tours and memoirs \\n Fiennes worked up her notes into a travel memoir in 1702, which she never published, intending it for family reading. It provides a vivid portrait of a still largely unenclosed countryside with few and primitive roads, although signposts (\"posts and hands pointing to each road with the names of the great towns or market towns that it leads to\") were appearing.  Robert Southey published extracts in 1812, and the first complete edition appeared in 1888 under the title Through England on a Side Saddle. A scholarly edition called The Journeys of Celia Fiennes was produced by Christopher Morris in 1947, and since then the book has been in print in a variety of editions.  Fiennes was interested in anything new, in innovations, bustling towns, the newly fashionable spa towns such as Bath and Harrogate, and in commerce. Fiennes\\\\\\'s patriotic justification for domestic tourism and her interest in the \"production and manufactures of each place\" anticipated the genre of \"economic tourism\" which became formalised with Daniel Defoe\\\\\\'s professional and survey-like A Tour through the Whole Island of Great Britain The economic tourist would become a staple of travel writing throughout the 18th and 19th centuries. Fiennes saw many of the finest baroque English country houses while they were still under construction. Contrary to the widespread conception that the visiting of \"stately homes\" began after the Second World War, they have been accessible to travellers of good social standing since Fiennes\\\\\\' time if not earlier, and her comments are one of the most interesting contemporary sources of information about them. At Stonehenge she counted the exact number of stones, and at Harrogate visited \"the sulphur or stinking spaw\". She also clambered over the rocks at Land\\\\\\'s End. \\n Remembered \\n Celia Fiennes died in Hackney in 1741. Her travels are the subject of a play, Riding England Sidesaddle by Christopher Goulding, which at the People\\\\\\'s Theatre, Newcastle upon Tyne in 1992, starring Andrea Riseborough as the young Celia Fiennes.\\'b\\' \\n Xml:tm \\n xml:tm (XML-based Text Memory) is a standard for XML to allow ease of translation of XML documents. xml:tm forms part of the Open Architecture for XML Authoring and Localization reference architecture.\\'b\\' \\n Clotiazepam \\n Indications \\n Clotiazepam has been trialed and found to be effective in the short-term management of anxiety. Clotiazepam is also used as a premedicant in minor surgery in France and Japan, where the drug is commercially available under the brand names Veratran and Rize, respectively. \\n Pharmacokinetics \\n A cross-over study in six healthy volunteers (median age 28 years) was conducted using single-dose pharmacokinetics of clotiazepam drops, oral tablets, and sublingual tablets. The formulations had similar systemic availability. Compared with oral tablets, the sublingual route gave a lower peak concentration and a delayed peak time, while drops gave a greater maximum concentration with a similar peak time. The use of drops is suggested for a more marked initial effect and the sublingual route for easier administration, especially in the elderly. \\n Pharmacology \\n Similar to other benzodiazepines clotiazepam has anxiolytic, sedative, hypnotic, amnesic, anticonvulsant and muscle relaxant pharmacological properties. Clotiazepam binds to the benzodiazepine site of the GABAA receptor where it acts as a full agonist; this action results in an enhanced GABA inhibitory effect at the GABAA receptor which results in the pharmacological effects of clotiazepam. Clotiazepam has a relatively short elimination half-life and is less prone to accumulation after repeated dosing compared to longer-acting benzodiazepine agents. It is metabolised via oxidation. Clotiazepam is metabolised to hydroxy-clotiazepam and desmethyl-clotiazepam. After oral ingestion of a single dose of clotiazepam by three healthy volunteers the drug was rapidly absorbed. The elimination half-life of the drug and its metabolites range from 6.5 hours to 18 hours. Clotiazepam is 99 percent bound to plasma protein. In elderly men the elimination half-life is longer and in elderly women the volume of distribution is increased. Individuals with liver impairment have a reduced volume of distribution as well as a reduced total clearance of clotiazepam; renal impairment does not affect the kinetics of clotiazepam. \\n Side effects \\n Drowsiness and asthenia are common side effects. There has been a report of hepatitis caused by clotiazepam. \\n Abuse \\n Clotiazepam is a recognised drug of abuse.\\'b\\' \\n Torysky \\n Torysky is a village and municipality in District in the Region of central-eastern Slovakia. \\n History \\n In historical records the village was first mentioned in 1284. Here was born the Greek-Catholic Bishop of Mukacheve Ivan Bradach \\n Geography \\n The municipality lies at an altitude of 810 metres and covers an area of 6.987 It has a population of about 390 people.\\'b\" \\n Terra Transport \\n Background \\n Canadian National Railways acquired the Newfoundland Railway from the Government of Newfoundland in 1949 under that dominion\\'s Terms of Union of entry into Confederation.  The majority of the Newfoundland Railway\\'s operations were not economically self-sustaining, requiring significant subsidization; however, it was only after the construction of the Trans-Canada Highway across the island in the early 1960s that the railway began to see serious declines in traffic. At the same time, CN took over the Newfoundland Railway\\'s ferry service between North Sydney, Nova Scotia and Port aux Basques, Newfoundland and promptly began to improve the service, bringing in vessels dedicated to carrying automobiles and trucks throughout the 1950s-1970s. By the early 1970s, CN faced increased scrutiny from federal politicians complaining about the railway\\'s continuous losses. Successive federal governments of the period had frequently forced the company to undertake various endeavours in the national interest, often at the expense of business and economic logic.  As a result, CN sought to restructure itself, placing many of these operations into separate subsidiaries to clarify the accounting behind their existence.  Restructuring applied to operations which lost money and required subsidization, or which were not part of CN\\'s core freight railway business. In 1977, all east coast ferries operated by CN were transferred to a new CN Subsidiary, CN Marine.  Passenger rail services were transferred to the new Crown corporation, Via Rail, and in 1979, all of CN\\'s freight railway operations on Newfoundland, along with the CN Roadcruiser Bus service and CN\\'s trucking operation, were placed into a new division named Terra Transport. \\n CN on Newfoundland \\n CN\\'s operations on Newfoundland revolved around the former Newfoundland Railway, which was the longest narrow-gauge railway in North America, stretching approximately across the island, from the ferry terminal in Port aux Basques to the provincial capital at St. John\\'s. Many of the island\\'s largest communities developed along the main line, largely because of their location; as a result, the Trans-Canada Highway paralleled its route in many places. Rail operations in Newfoundland remained economically unfeasible because of slow service times, a side effect of the narrow-gauge format. CN invested heavily in track improvements during the 1950s-1960s, but the narrow-gauge operation could not compete with the flexibility of trucks.  Significant time was lost at Port aux Basques, where standard-gauge railway cars from mainland North America were lifted off their bogies and onto narrow-gauge bogies for use on Newfoundland. In some cases this was not possible, and the rail car contents were unloaded and reloaded onto narrow-gauge cars. CN\\'s operation of dedicated railway car ferries was an additional expense. CN operated a main line passenger train, the Caribou, from St. John\\'s to Port aux Basques.  Nicknamed the Newfie Bullet, the Caribou operated until June 1969, when it was replaced by the CN Roadcruiser bus service started in the Fall of 1968. With the demise of the Caribou, the only passenger services remaining on the island were mixed freight and passenger trains on the Bonavista, Carbonear, and Argentia branch lines, and on the main-line between Bishop\\'s Falls and Corner Brook. Terra Transport would continue to operate mixed passenger/freight service on the branch lines until 1984. The mainline service between Corner Brook and Bishop\\'s Falls made its last run on 30 September 1988. The Roadcruiser bus service ran until 29 March 1996, when it was sold to DRL Coachlines of Triton, Newfoundland. The most significant change made under the Terra Transport subsidiary was the move to the carriage of less-than-carload (LCL) freight. A large fleet of distinctive green intermodal shipping containers were ordered and used in place of boxcars.  These containers were stacked on flatcars of mainland trains, fitted onto the decks inside the ferries, and then placed on flatcars of trains in Newfoundland, or transported entirely by truck. During the mid-1980s, trains composed almost entirely of the distinctive TT containers were common. The handling time for freight dropped considerably, as containers could be easily removed from the trains in each community and the loading/unloading at Port aux Basques was significantly improved over standard freight cars. Another significant change the closure and abandonment all of CN\\'s branch lines in the province by 1984, leaving only the main line operational. Despite these changes, Terra Transport was unable to turn a profit for CN and the federal government. Specialized ferries were still needed for carrying non-LCL railway cars, and by the mid-1980s were approaching the end of their operational life and required replacement. The election of a Conservative federal government brought about the elimination of subsidies for money-losing operations. In 1986, one of two remaining railcar ferries was sold off as the government converted CN Marine into Marine Atlantic, completely separating the rail and ferry services. Terra Transport operations were largely captive on Newfoundland and would specialize in handling import/export LCL and inter-island non-LCL freight. \\n Abandonment \\n In 1987, the federal government deregulated the railway industry in Canada and CN promptly applied to abandon its Newfoundland operations under Terra Transport. The political firestorm which followed saw the federal and provincial governments negotiate a one-time payout of $800 million (CAD) from Ottawa to St. John\\'s to fund highway improvements under the Trans-Canada Highway Program and the Regional Trunk Road Agreement. The agreements were signed in December 1987; however, continuing public outcry and legal challenges kept the railway operational for several months.  On 20 June 1988, it was officially announced that the railway would cease operations as of 1 September 1988. Some freight trains still ran until late September, with the last scheduled run on 29 September 1988. The last scheduled passenger train ran on 30 September 1988, from Bishops Falls to Corner Brook. Following official abandonment, the railway operated salvage trains, dismantling track in remote locations; some salvage trains were still operating in the summer of 1990.  Most of the track was removed and scrapped by November 1990. CN no longer has any operations in the Province of Newfoundland. In the fall of 1996 CN contracted out its intermodal trucking operation to Clarke Transport, which is now the local agent for CN. Since 1997, the old railbed has been reclaimed as the Newfoundland T\\'Railway Provincial Park.\"b\\' \\n Great Hagi Jaffar Dam \\n Geology \\n Awe Sherino Valley basin is located in the southern part of Zeer Mountain and southern Bust Gez Mountain is a beg Mount from Kukherd District (Persian: in the city of Bastak (Bastak County Hormozgan Province.\\'b\\' \\n Ping Gold Putter Vault \\n The Ping Gold Putter Vault provides the storage of the golf clubs from the Ping Gold Putter Program that was initiated by Karsten Solheim (Founder of American golf equipment manufacturer Ping), to commemorate a golfer\\\\\\'s victory using a Ping putter. Since the 1970s, tournament champions are presented with a gold-plated putter matching the specs of their putter and engraved with both their name and the name of the tournament won. A replica of the golf club is stored in a vault at the Ping headquarters in Phoenix, Arizona. \\n History \\n As a friend of Karsten Solheim, comedian Jackie Gleason inspired him to make golden Ping clubs. Gleason requested a gold Ping putter reasoning that everything that he has is gold. After getting the putter, Gleason asked Solheim if he could get a whole set made entirely of gold. Ping debuted a Vault line in 2016. Ping launched Vault 2.0 line in 2018. The Vault 2.0 club heads are finished with a gold color. As of January 2019, the Ping Gold Putter Vault contains over 3,000 golden clubs. The vault can grow in two ways: more wins with Ping clubs or documenting wins with Ping clubs that have not yet been recognized. Not all that have won a Tour event with Ping have received a golden club because they have been missed. If it can be documented that the win happened with Ping then the manufacture is very interested in adding that player\\\\\\'s golden club to the vault, and of course providing the player with theirs. In April 2014 Ping moved the \"Ping Gold Putter Vault\" because the collection had outgrown the size of vault being used. The oldest golden putter in the vault belongs to John Barnum for the Ping win of the 1962 Cajun Classic with a model 69. The collection includes winning putters from 106 major championships between the PGA Tour, PGA Tour Champions and LPGA Tour. All four men\\\\\\'s majors in 1988 have a golden club in the vault: the Masters Tournament (Sandy Lyle), the U.S. Open (Curtis Strange), The Open Championship (Seve Ballesteros), and the PGA Championship (Jeff Sluman). With more than 500 wins, the Ping Anser is in the vault the most. Ballesteros has the most gold clubs in the vault due to wins with Ping (47). Lee Westwood has the most golden clubs in the vault overall because as a Ping staff player there are clubs in the vault commemorating milestones and achievements. One of the few non-putter clubs in the room is the Ping Tour W wedge like the one Bubba Watson used for his recovery shot winning him the 2012 Masters Tournament. Watson won the 2014 Masters Tournament with a Ping Anser 1 Milled and Ping recognized the feat by making him a solid gold putter worth $30,000 in gold (as of 2014), rather than the \"standard\" gold-plated putter. Christie Kerr bought her 2007 U.S. Women\\\\\\'s Open winning Ping G59 Craz-E at a South Korean golf store. Two gold versions of Kerr\\\\\\'s winning putter were made, with one currently in the vault.\\'b\\' \\n Legio VI Herculia \\n Legio VI Herculia was a Roman legion levied by Diocletian in the end of the 3rd century, and was still in service at the beginning of the 5th century. The cognomen of the legion refers to Hercules, to whom Diocletian\\\\\\'s colleague, Maximian (also known as Herculius, \"the man like Hercules\"), was devoted and identified. In the tetrarchs provincial reforms, the province of Pannonia Inferior was divided into two, the northern part became Pannonia Valeria and the southern part became Pannonia Secunda. However the two legions of the province were stationed in the north at Brigetio and Aquincum leaving the southern province without any legions stationed there. The tetrarchs levied two more legions, Legio VI Herculia and Legio V Iovia. The VI Herculia  had her permanent camp in Teutoburgium (near modern Vukovar) and an advanced castellum in Onagrinum. They also protected the imperial residence of Diocletian in Sirmium which was also the provincial capital of the province and the Praetorian prefecture of Illyricum. The Notitia Dignitatum locates the legion still in Illyricum at the beginning of the 5th century. It is possible that some men from this legion and from the V Iovia formed the Herculians and Jovians, the new imperial bodyguard of Diocletian. If this identification is correct, VI Herculia men had the appellative Martiobarbuli, since they were expert in throwing small darts, martiobarbuli, carried by five in the inside of their shields.\\'b\\' \\n Pro Swooping tour \\n Tour format \\n Between 2003-2007 the PST used a point system to determine the overall ranking of competitors.

After his father had been reassigned to Canada, his mother and Dallaire immigrated to Canada when the boy was six months old, traveling on the Empire Brent. They landed in Halifax on December 13, 1946. The family lived in Montreal during Dallaire\\\\\\'s childhood. He enrolled in the Canadian Army in 1963, as a cadet at Le militaire royal de Saint-Jean. In 1970 he graduated from the Royal Military College of Canada with a Bachelor of Science degree and was commissioned into The Royal Regiment of Canadian Artillery. In 1971, Dallaire applied for a Canadian passport to travel overseas with his troops. He was surprised to learn that his birth as the son of a Canadian soldier, although in the Netherlands, did not give him automatic Canadian citizenship. He has subsequently become a Canadian citizen. Dallaire also attended the Canadian Land Force Command and Staff College, the United States Marine Corps Command and Staff College in Quantico, Virginia, and the British Higher Command and Staff Course. He commanded the d\\\\\\'artillerie du Canada. On July 3, 1989, he was promoted to the rank of brigadier-general. He commanded the 5 Canadian Mechanized Brigade Group. He was also the commandant of militaire royal de Saint-Jean from 1989 to 1991. \\n Original mission \\n In late 1993, Dallaire received his commission as the Major-General of UNAMIR, the United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda. UNAMIR\\\\\\'s goal was to assist in the implementation of the Arusha Accords, a peace agreement intended to end the Rwandan Civil War. The UN attempted to negotiate with the Hutus in the Rwandan army and with Habyarimana, a Hutu who was president at the time, and with the Tutsis, as represented by the rebel commander Paul Kagame, who led the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF). (He later was elected as President of Rwanda as of September 2017.) When Dallaire arrived in Rwanda, his mandate was to supervise the implementation of the accords during a transitional period in which Tutsis were to be given some positions of power within the Hutu-dominated government. There were early signs that something was amiss when, on January 22, 1994, a French DC-8 aircraft landed in Kigali, the capital of Rwanda, loaded with ammunition and weapons for the Rwandan Armed Forces (FAR). (FAR was the Hutu army under Habyarimana\\\\\\'s control.) Dallaire notified the UN by fax, suggesting he seize these weapons to prevent violence, but the UN deemed this action to be beyond his UN mandate. In addition to the arms deliveries, he learned that troops from the Rwandan government began checking identity cards, which identified individuals by ethnicity as Hutu or Tutsi. \\n Genocide \\n On 11 January 1994, General Dallaire, commander of UNAMIR, sent his \"Genocide Fax\" to UN Headquarters. The fax stated that Dallaire was in contact with \"a top level trainer in the cadre of Interhamwe-armed [sic] militia of MRND.\" The informant claimed to have been ordered to register all Tutsi in Kigali. According to the memo, the informant suspected that a genocide against the Tutsis was being planned, and he said that \"in 20 minutes his personnel could kill up to 1000 Tutsis\". Dallaire\\\\\\'s request to protect the informant and his family and to raid the weapons caches he revealed was denied by the UN. The result was a genocide of between 500,000 and 1,000,000. Seven out of every 10 Tutsis were killed. UNAMIR commander Dallaire learned of the Hutu Power movement during the mission\\\\\\'s deployment, as well as plans for the mass extermination of Tutsi. He also became aware of secret weapons caches through an informant, but his request to raid them was turned down by the UN Department of Peacekeeping Operations (DPKO), which felt that Dallaire was exceeding his mandate and had to be kept \"on a leash\". Seizing the weapons was argued to be squarely within UNAMIR\\\\\\'s mandate; both sides had requested UNAMIR and it had been authorized by the UN Security Council in Resolution 872. UNAMIR\\\\\\'s effectiveness in peacekeeping was also hampered by President Habyarimana and Hutu hardliners, and by April 1994, the Security Council threatened to terminate UNAMIR\\\\\\'s mandate if it did not make progress. Following the death of Habyarimana, and the start of the genocide, Dallaire liaised repeatedly with both the Crisis Committee and the RPF, attempting to re-establish peace and prevent the resumption of the civil war. Neither side was interested in a ceasefire, the government because it was controlled by the genocidaires, and the RPF because it considered it necessary to fight to stop the killings. UNAMIR\\\\\\'s Chapter VI mandate rendered it powerless to intervene militarily, and most of its Rwandan staff were killed in the early days of the genocide, severely limiting its ability to operate. UNAMIR was therefore largely reduced to a bystander role, and Dallaire later labelled it a \"failure\". Its most significant contribution was to provide refuge for thousands of Tutsi and moderate Hutu at its headquarters in Amahoro Stadium, as well as other secure UN sites, and to assist with the evacuation of foreign nationals. On 12 April, the Belgian government, which was one of the largest troop contributors to UNAMIR, and had lost ten soldiers protecting Prime Minister Uwilingiliyimana, announced that it was withdrawing, reducing the force\\\\\\'s effectiveness even further.   Dallaire was later on severely criticized by the Belgian parliamentary commission for his role leading to the torture and murder of ten members of the 2nd Commando Battalion and their protected charge. While Lieutenant Lotin and his men were being tortured and murdered, General Dallaire passed by at 60 metres. Seeing the Belgium soldiers General Dallaire did not intervene. In his answer to the martial council he would later say \"I did not know whether they were dead or injured.\" He went on to meet officers of the Rwanda army at the Military School, but did not mention the event. The company of the Bangladeshi Battalion which had the task of Quick Reaction Force was ill prepared and did not leave their barracks. After those events Belgium withdrew its forces from Rwanda. Dallaire considered them to be his best-trained and best-equipped forces. The commission of inquiry of the Belgian Senate in 1998 severely condemned actions during those days. According to the parliamentary commission Dallaire adopted an overly reserved attitude in the months before the genocide undermining the credibility of UNAMIR in the eyes of the Rwandans. Furthermore actions were considered to be and unprofessional to have the Belgian escorts provided on 7 April with so few military In addition, the commission stated it \"did not understand why general Dallaire, who had noted the blue beret bodies in the Kigali camp, did not communicate this immediately to the FAR\\\\\\'S high-ranking officers at the meeting of the and did not demand the urgent intervention of those Rwandan officers present. This appears to reflect considerable indifference on his part. Moreover, general Dallaire also neglected to inform his sector commander about what he had seen and to give the necessary instructions\". On 17 May 1994, the UN passed Resolution 918, which imposed an arms embargo and reinforced UNAMIR, which would be known as UNAMIR II.  The new soldiers did not start arriving until June, and following the end of the genocide in July, the role of UNAMIR II was largely confined to maintaining security and stability, until its termination in 1996. Several individuals attempted to halt the Rwandan genocide, or to shelter vulnerable Tutsi. Among them were Dallaire (Canadian Lieutenant-General of UNAMIR), Henry Kwami Anyidoho (Ghanaian Deputy Commander of UNAMIR), Pierantonio Costa (Italian diplomat who rescued many lives), Antonia Locatelli (Italian volunteer who in 1992, two years before the actual genocide, tried to save 300 or 400 Tutsis by calling officials in the international community and was later murdered by the Interahamwe), Jacqueline Mukansonera (Hutu woman who saved a Tutsi during the genocide), Zura Karuhimbi (Hutu elderly widow who sheltered more than 100 refugees in her village home, posing as a witch to repel and frighten militiamen), Paul Rusesabagina (the Academy Award nominated film Hotel Rwanda is based on his story), Carl Wilkens (the only American who chose to remain in Rwanda during the genocide), Sibomana (Hutu priest and journalist who saved many lives) and Captain Mbaye Diagne (Senegalese army officer of UNAMIR who saved many lives before he was killed). Dallaire gave the major force contributors different evaluations for their work. In his book, he gave the Tunisian and Ghanaian contingents high praise for their valiant and competent work.  Three of Ghana\\\\\\'s peacekeepers died in the warfare. \\n End to the genocide \\n As the massacre progressed and the press covered the genocide more widely, the U.N. Security Council backtracked and voted to establish UNAMIR II, with a strength of 5,500 men, in response to the French plan to occupy portions of the country. (Dallaire initially opposed the so-called French Turquoise, because the French had a history of backing the Hutus and the Rwandan Armed Forces. He believed their presence would be opposed by Kagame and the rebel Rwandan Patriotic Front). It was not until early July, when RPF troops under Kagame swept into Kigali, that the genocide ended. By August, the French had handed their portion of the country to the RPF, giving Kagame effective control of all of Rwanda. Testimony at the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda demonstrated that the genocide was brutally efficient, lasting for a total of 100 days and leading to the murder of 800,000 Tutsi, Hutu moderates and Twa. More than two million people were displaced internally or in neighbouring countries. The genocide ended when the Rwandan Patriotic Front gained control of Rwanda on July 18, 1994. But political unrest and violence have continued, with recrimination and retribution. The government continues to conduct criminal prosecutions in the war. \\n Life after Rwanda \\n Upon his return to Canada from UNOMUR and UNAMIR, Dallaire was appointed to two simultaneous commands in September 1994: Deputy Commander of Land Force Command (LFC) in Saint-Hubert, Quebec and Commander of 1 Canadian Division. In October 1995, Dallaire assumed command of Land Force Quebec Area. In 1996, Dallaire was promoted to Chief of Staff and to the Assistant Deputy Minister (Personnel) Group at NDHQ. In 1998, he was assigned to Assistant Deputy Minister (Human Resources Military) and in 1999 was appointed Special Advisor to the Chief of the Defence Staff on Officer Professional Development. Dallaire suffered from posttraumatic stress disorder and in 2000, attempted suicide by combining alcohol with his anti-depressant medication, a near fatal combination which left him comatose.  Dallaire is an outspoken supporter of raising awareness for veterans\\\\\\' mental health. In January 2004, Dallaire appeared at the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda to testify against Colonel Bagosora. (The testimony was critical to the outcome of the trial and in December 2008 Bagosora was convicted of genocide and for the command responsibility of the murders of the 10 Belgian Peacekeepers. The trial chamber held that: \"it is clear that the killing of the peacekeepers formed part of the widespread and systematic attack\", while at the same time holding that: \"the evidence suggests that these killings were not necessarily part of a highly coordinated plan.\") He later worked as a Special Advisor to the Canadian Government on War Affected Children and the Prohibition of Small Arms Distribution, as well as with international agencies with the same focus, including child labour. In he served as a fellow at the Carr Center For Human Rights Policy at Harvard University\\\\\\'s John F. Kennedy School of Government. \\n Appointment to Canadian Senate \\n On March 24, 2005, Dallaire was appointed to the Senate of Canada by Governor General Adrienne Clarkson on the advice of Prime Minister Paul Martin. He represented the province of Quebec and sat as a Liberal until January 29, 2014, when he along with all of his Liberal Senate peers were removed from the party caucus by party leader Justin Trudeau, after which he officially sat as an Independent Liberal. Dallaire noted that his family has supported both the Liberal Party of Canada and the Quebec Liberal Party since 1958. He supported Michael Ignatieff\\\\\\'s unsuccessful 2006 bid for the leadership of the federal Liberal Party. In 2007, Dallaire called for the reopening of militaire royal de Saint-Jean, saying \"The possibility of starting a new program at the college a military college that would allow all officer cadets to spend two years in Saint-Jean before going to Kingston, instead of studying only in Kingston is being considered. In the spirit of progress, would it be possible to support a principle as basic as the freedom of francophones in the Canadian Armed Forces by establishing a CEGEP-style francophone bilingual military college.\" Concordia University announced on September 8, 2006, that Dallaire would sit as Senior Fellow at the Montreal Institute for Genocide and Human Rights Studies (MIGS), a research centre based at the university\\\\\\'s Faculty of Arts & Science. Later that month, on September 29, 2006, he issued a statement urging the international community to be prepared to defend in Iran from possible atrocities. Dallaire has worked to bring understanding of post-traumatic stress disorder to the general public. His 2016 book, Waiting for First Light: My Ongoing Battle with PTSD, details his own struggles with this operational stress injury.  He has been a visiting lecturer at several Canadian and American universities. He was a Fellow of the Carr Center for Human Rights Policy, Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University. He pursued research on conflict resolution and the use of child soldiers.  He published the book, They Fight Like Soldiers, They Die Like Children: the Global Quest to Eradicate the Use of Child Soldiers in 2010.  He has written several articles and chapters in publications on conflict resolution, humanitarian assistance and human rights. In 2013, Senator Dallaire voiced his concern objecting to the 2014 budget closure of nine veterans affairs offices and the dismissal of 900 VA staff as well $226M CAD of funding cut from the program. Early in Dallaire\\\\\\'s post military career he was tasked by the Department of National Defense (DND), to create a program that will support the rehabilitation needs of former military personnel. Dallaire is a supporter of the Campaign for the Establishment of a United Nations Parliamentary Assembly, an organisation which advocates for democratic reformation of the United Nations. On December 3, 2013, Dallaire was in a car accident on Parliament Hill, Ottawa. His car, a black BMW, hit a lamp post before it was stopped. Dallaire said he had fallen asleep at the wheel due to stress. His vehicle\\\\\\'s air bag deployed and there were no casualties. Dallaire resigned from the Senate on June 17, 2014, seven years prior to reaching mandatory retirement. He decided to leave the Senate in order to spend more time public speaking, to do research on and due to his own struggles with posttraumatic stress disorder, due to his frustration with the ongoing Canadian Senate expenses scandal, and to devote the majority of his time on the issue of eradicating the use of child soldiers through his Dallaire Child Soldiers Initiative. \\n Books \\n Dallaire has written three books. Shake Hands with the Devil: The Failure of Humanity in Rwanda, written with Major Brent Beardsley and published in 2003, chronicles his tour as Force Commander of UNAMIR in during which he witnessed the Rwandan Genocide. It won the 2003 Shaughnessy Cohen Award for Political Writing, and the 2004 Governor General\\\\\\'s Award for nonfiction. It was subsequently adapted for two films, a documentary and a feature film. They Fight Like Soldiers, They Die Like Children: The Global Quest to Eradicate the Use of Child Soldiers (written with Jessica Dee Humphreys) was published in 2010. It discusses the phenomenon of child soldiers, and proposes solutions to eradicate it. It was one of the Globe and Mail\\\\\\'s best books of 2010. Waiting for First Light: My Ongoing Battle with PTSD (also with Jessica Dee Humphreys) is Dallaire\\\\\\'s account of his struggles with post-traumatic stress disorder after his time in Rwanda. It was selected as one of the National Post\\\\\\'s top books of 2016, and is nominated for the RBC Charles Taylor Prize for Literary Non-Fiction. Dallaire has contributed chapters or forewords to several other works. \\n Books about Dallaire \\n A Problem from Hell: America and the Age of Genocide by Samantha Power.   In a 2004 opinion article published by The New York Times, Dallaire called upon NATO to intervene militarily alongside African Union troops to abort the genocide in Darfur. He concluded that, \"having called what is happening in Darfur genocide and having vowed to stop it, it is time for the West to keep its word as well.\" \\n Documentary and film \\n In October 2002, the documentary The Last Just Man was released, which chronicles the Rwandan genocide and features interviews with Dallaire, Brent Beardsley, and others involved in the events that happened in Rwanda. It was directed by Steven Silver. A character loosely based on Dallaire was portrayed by Nick Nolte in Hotel Rwanda (2004). A documentary film, entitled Shake Hands with the Devil: The Journey of Dallaire, which was inspired by the book and shows Gen Dallaire\\\\\\'s return to Rwanda after ten years, was produced by the CBC, SRC and White Pine Pictures, and released in 2004. The film was nominated for two Sundance Film Festival Awards, winning the 2004 Sundance Film Festival Audience Award for World Cinema Documentary and a nomination for Grand Jury Prize for World Cinema Documentary. The film aired on CBC on January 31, 2005. Shake Hands With The Devil won the Emmy award for Outstanding Documentary with the U.S. Documentary Channel, who presented it on their channel. In 2004, PBS Frontline featured a documentary named The Ghosts of Rwanda. In an interview conducted for the documentary and recorded over the course of four days in October 2003, Dallaire said: \"Rwanda will never ever leave me. It\\\\\\'s in the pores of my body. My soul is in those hills, my spirit is with the spirits of all those people who were slaughtered and killed that I know of, and many that I didn\\\\\\'t A Canadian dramatic feature film Shake Hands with the Devil adapted from Dallaire\\\\\\'s 2003 book and starring Roy Dupuis as Lieutenant-General Dallaire, started production in mid-June 2006, and was released on September 28, 2007. Dallaire participated in a press conference about the film held on June 2, 2006, in Montreal, a film for which he was being consulted. The film earned 12 Genie Award nominations and won one in the category Best Achievement in Music Original Song for the song \"Kaya\" by Valanga Khoza and David Hirschfelder. In September 2007, \\n Awards and recognition \\n In 1996, Dallaire was made an Officer of the Legion of Merit of the United States, the highest US military decoration available for award to foreigners, for his service in Rwanda. Dallaire was also awarded the inaugural Aegis Trust Award in 2002, and on October 10 of the same year, he was inducted as an Officer in the Order of Canada.  Dallaire was named a Grand Officer of the National Order of Quebec in 2005. He was granted the inaugural Aegis Award for Genocide Prevention from the Aegis Trust (United Kingdom).  On March 9, 2005, Dallaire was awarded the 25th Pearson Medal of Peace. In 2019 (the 25th anniversary of the Genocide in Rwanda), the Government of Canada announced the establishment of the Dallaire Centre for Peace and Security. That same year, Dallaire was awarded the Nelson Mandela Award for Human Rights , the University of Victoria\\\\\\'s Huminatis Award, and was also awarded the Adrienne Clarkson Prize for Global Citizenship . Dallaire has received honorary doctorates from a large number of Canadian and American universities. He received Doctor of Laws degrees from the University of Guelph, University of Saskatchewan, St. Thomas University, Boston College, the University of Calgary, Memorial University of Newfoundland, Athabasca University, Trent University, the University of Victoria, the University of Western Ontario, Concordia University, and Simon Fraser University, an honorary Doctor of Humanities degree from the University of Lethbridge and honorary degrees from the University of Northern British Columbia and the University of York. On June 1, 2006, Romeo Dallaire was awarded a Doctorate of Humane Letters by the Queens College of the City University of New York (CUNY) in recognition of his efforts in Rwanda and afterwards to speak out against genocide. He received an ovation from the crowd for his comment that \"no human is more human than any other\".  Dallaire received the Loyola Medal from Concordia University in 2006. Dallaire was named a Fellow of the Ryerson Polytechnic University, and an Honorary Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada.  On October 11, 2006, the Center for Unconventional Security Affairs at the University of California, Irvine awarded Dallaire with the 2006 Human Security Award. In 2002, Dallaire was given Canada\\\\\\'s World Peace Award, in recognition of his peacekeeping experience and study of children in conflict, by the World Federalist Movement-Canada  General Dallaire planted a tree at the Kofi Annan International Peacekeeping Training Centre, Accra, Ghana in 2007 at the invitation of the Commandant, Major-General John Attipoe.  Dallaire was a recipient of the Vimy Award. His book Shake Hands with the Devil: The Failure of Humanity in Rwanda, was awarded the Governor General\\\\\\'s Literary Award for Non-Fiction in 2004. As part of the 50th Anniversary commemoration of the founding of the Pugwash Peace Exchange, in 2007 General Dallaire accepted Sir Joseph Rotblat\\\\\\'s Nobel Peace Prize. Dallaire was one of the eight Olympic Flag bearers at the opening ceremony for the 2010 Olympic Winter Games, in Vancouver.   The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation\\\\\\'s The Greatest Canadian program saw Dallaire voted, in 16th place, as the highest rated military figure.  There are elementary schools named after Dallaire in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Ajax, Ontario, and a French-immersion elementary school in Maple, Ontario. There is also a French High school in Barrie, Ontario. that is named for Dallaire. Also, a street is named after him in the Lincoln Park neighbourhood of Calgary, Alberta.\\'b\\' \\n Izumi Province \\n Name \\n The name \"Izumi\" means \"fountain\" or \"spring\" but is written with two characters, the character for \"peace\" being prepended due to an imperial edict in 713. This character does not play into the reading. Because the provincial capital was in modern town, Izumi city, Osaka Prefecture, the city adopted the name of the province as its name. \\n Development \\n According to the Shoku Nihongi, the Izumi and Hine districts were separated from Kawachi Province on 23 April 716; moreover, on 8 May that same year, the District was also separated from Kawachi, and the three districts constructed Izumi-gen The imperial villa of Chinu Palace Chinu no Miya, also known as Izumi Palace) was in Izumi, and it seems that this has something to do with the unusual classification of gen Yoshino-gen was the only other province with this designation. Afterwards, on 15 September 740, it was abolished and merged back into Kawachi province. On 30 May 757, it was re-established with a normal province designation kuni According to the Nihongi Ryaku, on 21 April 825, the four Settsu Province districts of Higashinari, Nishinari, Kudara, and Sumiyoshi were incorporated into Izumi Province, but the residents were opposed to it, so they were restored to Settsu on 8 August the same year. In the Edo period, Kishiwada Domain (Koide tozama, Matsudaira/Matsui fudai, Okabe fudai; koku) and Hakata Domain (Watanabe fudai; 13500 koku) were established. Sometime in 1870 or 1871 (the beginning of the Meiji era), the boundary with Settsu Province was changed to the Yamato River (it was formerly the roads of and Nagao \\n Capital \\n The provincial capital was in the Izumi District, which is now around Izumi. The ruins of its buildings are being excavated. The shugo\\\\\\'s residence was right by the capital, but it was transferred to Sakai in the Muromachi period. \\n Shrines and temples \\n The only grand shrine was Shrine in District Sakai), ranking among the Taisha; it also became Izumi primary shrine. The secondary shrine was Izumi-Anashi Shrine (Toyonaka, the tertiary shrine was Hijiri Shrine Izumi), the quaternary Tsugawa Shrine (Tsugawa, Kishiwada), and the quinary Hine Shrine (Hineno, Izumisano). However, Hine Shrine was listed as the quaternary shrine in a 1501 document. The was the Five Shrine complex at Izumi-Inoue Shrine in the capital, where the kami of the above five shrines were also enshrined. The provincial temple was Fukutoku-ji (Kokubu, Izumi). It was only for monks, there was no temple available for nuns.\\'b\\' \\n Aluminium price-fixing conspiracy \\n The aluminium price-fixing conspiracy was an alleged effort by Goldman Sachs Group Inc, JPMorgan Chase & Co, Glencore Xstrata and their warehouse companies to inflate the price of aluminium by creating artificial supply shortages at their warehouses between 2010 and 2013. On July 20, 2013 the New York Times published an article outlining the scheme which subsequently brought about the attention of the United States Justice Department. The New York Times went on to estimate that the actions of the accused cost American consumers almost $5 billion during its duration.\\'b\" \\n Sebastopol, California \\n 2010 \\n The 2010 United States Census reported that Sebastopol had a population of 7,379. The population density was 3,982.4 people per square mile The racial makeup of Sebastopol was 6,509 (88.2%) White, 72 (1.0%) African American, 60 (0.8%) Native American, 120 (1.6%) Asian, 19 (0.3%) Pacific Islander, 298 (4.0%) from other races, and 301 (4.1%) from two or more races.  Hispanic or Latino of any race were 885 persons (12.0%). The Census reported that 98.3% of the population lived in households and 1.7% were institutionalized. There were 3,276 households, out of which 902 (27.5%) had children under the age of 18 living in them, 1,220 (37.2%) were opposite-sex married couples living together, 478 (14.6%) had a female householder with no husband present, 156 (4.8%) had a male householder with no wife present.  There were 206 (6.3%) unmarried opposite-sex partnerships, and 52 (1.6%) same-sex married couples or partnerships. 1,132 households (34.6%) were made up of individuals and 498 (15.2%) had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.21.  There were 1,854 families (56.6% of all households); the average family size was 2.82. The population was spread out with 1,515 people (20.5%) under the age of 18, 471 people (6.4%) aged 18 to 24, 1,587 people (21.5%) aged 25 to 44, 2,525 people (34.2%) aged 45 to 64, and 1,281 people (17.4%) who were 65 years of age or older.  The median age was 46.1 years. For every 100 females, there were 79.9 males.  For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 76.7 males. There were 3,465 housing units with an average density of 1,870.0 per square mile of which 52.9% were owner-occupied and 47.1% were occupied by renters. The homeowner vacancy rate was 0.7%; the rental vacancy rate was 4.2%. 53.7% of the population lived in owner-occupied housing units and 44.5% lived in rental housing units. The median income for a household in the city was $60,322 (+29.9% from 2000), and the median income for a family was $74,020 (+32.7% from 2000). The median per capita income for the city was $29,470 (+28.8% from 2000). For comparison, statewide California median per capita income in the 2010 Census was $27,885 (+22.8% from 2000). \\n 2000 \\n As of the census of 2000, there were 7,774 people, 3,250 households, and 1,953 families residing in the city.  The population density was  There were 3,321 housing units at an average density of  The racial makeup of the city was 89.85% White, 0.66% African American, 0.78% Native American, 1.52% Asian, 0.10% Pacific Islander, 3.86% from other races, and 3.23% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 9.26% of the population. There were 3,250 households out of which 31.8% included children under the age of 18 in the house, 41.5% were married couples living together, 14.2% were led by a female householder with no husband present, and 39.9% were other living arrangements. 31.8% of all households were made up of a single individual and 14.3% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older.  The average household size was 2.33 and the average family size was 2.95. For the most part the population is spread out across the age groups, although the young adult population is drastically lower than the other groups, indicating that most young people leave, at least temporarily.  The reasons for this are probably a combination of the high cost of living and the lack of other young adults. The percent distribution on the 2000 census by age was as follows: 23.6% under the age of 18, 7.4% from 18 to 24, 25.0% from 25 to 44, 27.6% from 45 to 64, and 16.5% who were 65 years of age or older.  The median age was 42 years. For every 100 females, there were 81.1 males.  For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 75.3 males. The median income for a household in the city was $46,436, and the median income for a family was $55,792. Males had a median income of $40,538 versus $32,399 for females. The per capita income for the city was $22,881.  About 4.7% of families and 6.9% of the population were below the poverty line, including 6.7% of those under age 18 and 6.0% of those age 65 or over. \\n State and federal \\n In the California State Legislature, Sebastopol is in the  10th Assembly District, represented by Democrat Marc Levine, and California\\'s 2nd State Senate district, represented by Mike McGuire. Federally, Sebastopol is in California\\'s  2nd congressional district, represented by Democrat Jared Huffman. According to the California Secretary of State, as of February 10, 2019, Sebastopol has 5,285 registered voters. Of those, 3,346 (63.3%) are registered Democrats, 518 (9.8%) are registered Republicans, and 1,137 (21.5%) have declined to state a political party. \\n Education \\n Sebastopol Union operates two elementary schools: Parkside (K-4) and Brook Haven (5-8). Sebastopol Charter, a K-8 public charter school, had the highest percentage (58%) of kindergarten students with medical exemptions to vaccines in California as of the summer of 2018. At most, 3% of students should have a medical exemption; schools with high rates of non-immune students are at increased risk from outbreaks of vaccine-preventable illnesses.\"b\\' \\n Netley Abbey \\n Foundation \\n Netley was conceived by the influential  Peter des Roches, who was Bishop of Winchester from 1205 until his death in 1238; the abbey was founded shortly after his death, in 1239. The founder\\\\\\'s charter shows the name of the abbey as \"the church of St Mary of Edwardstow\", or the Latin \"Ecclesia Sanctae Mariae de loco Sancti Edwardi\" although the title of the charter calls it \"Letley\"; the present name of Netley is most likely derived from this. The abbey was one of a pair of monasteries which the bishop intended as a memorial to himself; the other is La in Saint-Paterne-Racan, France. Des Roches began to purchase the lands for Netley\\\\\\'s initial endowment in about 1236, but he died before the project was finished and the foundation was completed by his executors. According to the Chronicle of Waverley Abbey, the first monks arrived to settle the site on 1239 from neighbouring Beaulieu Abbey, a year after the bishop\\\\\\'s death. The fact of its founder prior death before designation of the endowment was complete, put the incipient abbey in a difficult financial situation. It is thought that only after the house was taken under the wing of Henry III, who became interested in it in the mid-1240s, was progress made on the buildings. The King eventually assumed the role of patron in 1251. \\n Church \\n The fruits of royal patronage were demonstrated by the construction of a large church (72 metres long), built in the fashionable French-influenced Gothic style pioneered by Henry\\\\\\'s masons at Westminster Abbey. The high quality and elaborate nature of the church\\\\\\'s decoration, particularly its mouldings and tracery, indicate how the machine of royal patronage lead to a move away from the deliberate austerity of the early Cistercian churches towards the grandeur then considered appropriate to a secular church such as a cathedral. Construction of the church proceeded from east to west. The sanctuary and transepts were built first to allow the monks to hold services, and the nave was completed over time. It is not known precisely when the building work began, but major gifts by King Henry of roofing timber and lead from Derbyshire in 1251 and 1252 indicate that some of the eastern parts of the church, and probably of the east cloister range too, had by then reached an advanced stage. The presence of a foundation stone at the base of the southeast pier of the crossing inscribed \"H. DI. GRA REX ANGE\" (Latin for Henry by the Grace of God King of the English) shows that the foundations of the centre of the church reached ground level after 1251, the year Henry III formally became the abbey\\\\\\'s patron. Taking many decades to complete, the church was probably finished between 1290 and 1320. Dating the various parts of the building relies predominantly on stylistic criteria. The church was cruciform in shape, with vaulting and a square sanctuary and a low central tower containing bells. It was aisled throughout, with a pair of chapels on the east side of each transept. There was no triforium, but a narrow gallery surmounted by a clerestory of triple lancet windows ran above each bay of the arcade, as can be seen in the surviving section in the south transept. The vaulting sprang directly from the top of the arcade. The wall at the eastern end of the sanctuary, probably built after 1260, had a large window which features an upper rose and elaborate tracery; the aisle windows were simple paired lancets recessed within an arch. In the nave, the south aisle had plain triple lancets set high in the wall to avoid the cloister roof. The north aisle windows by contrast had richly decorated cusped tracery, reflecting the changes in taste over the long period of construction, and suggesting that this was among the last parts of the church to be finished, probably in the very late thirteenth or early fourteenth centuries. The west wall of the church also has a large window, the tracery of which was destroyed in a collapse during the eighteenth century. Surviving fragments show that it was built in a \"freer and more advanced style\" than other parts of the church, and suggest a date around the turn of the fourteenth century. Internally, the church was subdivided into several areas. The high altar was against the east wall of the sanctuary, flanked by two smaller altars on the side walls. To the west, under the tower, were the monks\\\\\\' choir stalls where they sat during services, and further west was a pulpitum or rood screen, which blocked access to the ritual areas of the church. In the nave, the lay brothers had their own choir stalls and altar for services. The monks of Netley kept up a schedule of services and prayer both day and night following the traditional canonical hours; a staircase in the south transept went up to the monks\\\\\\' dormitory, allowing them to convenient access to the night services. The lay brothers had their own entrance to the church at the west end via a covered gallery from their accommodation. Unlike other orders of monks who allowed parishioners and visitors admission to the nave, the Cistercians officially reserved their churches solely for the use of the monastic community. Others had to worship in a separate chapel in the abbey grounds close to the main gate. Over time this rule was relaxed to allow pilgrims to visit shrines, as at Hailes Abbey with its relic of the Holy Blood, and to allow the construction of tombs and chantries for patrons and wealthy benefactors of the house, as in the churches of other orders. Excavated sculpture shows that the church at Netley featured a number of elaborate tombs and monuments. The interior of the church was richly decorated. The walls were plastered and painted in white and maroon with geometric patterns and lines designed to give the impression of ashlar masonry. Architectural detail was also picked out in maroon. The floors were covered in polychrome encaustic tiles featuring foliage, heraldic beasts, and coats of arms including those of England, France, the Holy Roman Empire, Queen Eleanor of Castile, Richard of Cornwall and many powerful noble families. The chapels in the south transept had tiles with symbols of Edward the Confessor and the Virgin Mary. The windows of the church were filled with painted glass, six panels of which have been recovered. They show scenes from the life of the Virgin Mary, the Crucifixion, monks, monsters and humorous animals. \\n Cloister and east range \\n South of the church stands a cloister surrounded by ranges of buildings on three sides, the church forming the fourth. As is known, the cloister was the heart of the abbey, where the monks spent most of their time when not in church, engaged in study, copying books and the creation of illuminated manuscripts. The monks\\\\\\' desks were placed in the north walk of the cloister, and a cupboard for books in current use was carved into the external wall of the south transept. The east range, which was started at the same time as the church and probably took about 10 years to build, contained many of the abbey\\\\\\'s most important rooms. The vaulted library and sacristy were on the ground floor, adjacent to the church. To the south was the chapter house, where the deliberations of the abbey took place and the monks met to transact business and to listen to a daily reading of a chapter of the Rule of St Benedict. At Netley this was a magnificent apartment divided into three aisles with vaults springing from four columns; a stone bench ran around the walls for the monks to sit on, and the abbot\\\\\\'s throne was in the centre of the east wall. The entrance to the chapter house from the cloister is via an elaborately moulded arched doorway, flanked on each side by a window of similar size. The windows had sills and columns of Purbeck Marble, the whole forming an impressive composition appropriate to the second most important space in the abbey after the church. The windows on either side of the door would have been unglazed, so as to allow representatives of the laybrothers (who were not members of chapter) to listen to debates. The chapter house was also the site of some tombs, traditionally those of the abbots of a monastery. When the room was excavated, archaeologists discovered scattered human remains and evidence of graves beneath the medieval floor level, indicating that a number of burials. The parlour lies south, an austere, barrel vaulted room little more than a passageway through the building. Here the monks could talk without disturbing the silence in the cloister, which Cistercian rules insisted on. South of this runs a long vaulted hall with a central row of pillars supporting the roof. This room was much altered over time and probably served several purposes during the lifetime of the abbey. Initially, it may have served as the monks\\\\\\' day room and accommodation for novices, but as time went on it may have been converted into the misericord where the only the sick, but by the later middle ages the whole eat meat dishes not normally allowed in the main dining hall.  The monks\\\\\\' dormitory was on the top floor of the east range, a long room with a high pitched roof (the mark of which can still be seen on the transept wall) which ran the length of the building. This was entered by two staircases: the day stair went down into the cloister in the south-east corner; the night stair led into the south transept of the church to allow the monks to get easily from bed to choir at night. Initially the dormitory was an open hall, with the monks\\\\\\' beds placed along the walls, one under each of the small, slit-like windows. During the fourteenth century, when views of the necessity of sleeping in the same space together for the common life changed, the dormitory at Netley would, as at other houses, have been divided into sections with wooden dividers to give every monk his own private area, each leading off a central corridor. The treasury, a tiny vaulted room, was at the north end of the dormitory, preumably located for security at night. \\n Reredorter and infirmary \\n Another large building lies crosswise at the south end of the east range. Its lower level consists of a vaulted hall equipped with a grand thirteenth-century hooded fireplace and its own garderobe. It is not clear what this chamber was used for, but it may have been the monastic so, it was a most unusual, perhaps unique, arrangement. Normally in a medieval Cistercian monastery an infirmary with its own kitchens, chapel and ancillary buildings would have been located east of the main buildings around a second, smaller cloister, but at Netley these seem to be absent. So far, excavations have not revealed whether Netley had a separate infirmary complex. The upper floor of this building was the reredorter or latrine. It is a large room with a door conveniently leading into the monks\\\\\\' dormitory. The stalls were in the south wall and the effluent dropped into an underground stream which runs in a vaulted passage underneath the building. To the west of the reredorter block was the buttery, a room where the monks\\\\\\' wine (some of it direct from the king\\\\\\'s cellars at Southampton) and beer were stored. Excavations in this area have revealed fragmentary remains which may be part of a separate kitchen for the richer diet allowed to the residents of the infirmary. \\n South range \\n During the Tudor conversion of the abbey to a private house the south range was extensively rebuilt, and only the north wall of the medieval structure remains, which makes tracing the monastic layout difficult. Going east to west, first came the day stair, then the warming house where the communal fire burned constantly to allow the monks to warm themselves after long hours of study in the unheated cloister. The room was probably vaulted and had its great fireplace on the west wall to allow heat to rise to the refectory or dining hall next door. It is likely that, as at the great Cistercian house Fountains Abbey, the chamber above the warming house was the muniment room, where the abbey\\\\\\'s charters, records and title deeds, as well as those of local lords, were kept. The refectory projected south from the centre of the range, as was usual in Cistercian monasteries. This is now almost completely demolished save for the north wall, although the foundations survive underground and have been excavated. It was a long hall with a dais for the abbot and important guests at the south end. There was a pulpit in the west wall to allow a monk to read to the community during the meal. The kitchen lies west; it had a central fireplace, as was Cistercian custom, and was placed to allow food to be served through hatches both to the choir monks\\\\\\' refectory and to the separate dining hall for the lay brothers on the west side. \\n West range \\n The west range at Netley is small and does not run the full length of the west side of the cloister. It is divided in two by the original main entrance to the abbey, with an outer parlour where the monks could meet visitors. North of this on the ground floor were cellars for food storage, and to the south was the lay brothers\\\\\\' refectory. The upper floor, reached by a stair from the cloister, was the dormitory for the lay brothers. Netley was a late foundation, built at a time when the lay brothers were a declining part of the Cistercian economy, and it is probable that they were fewer in number, hence the small size of the accommodation needed. By the time the west range was completed in the fourteenth century they were rapidly disappearing, and had all but vanished by the end of the century. During the late fourteenth and fifteenth centuries most Cistercian houses took advantage of the large area of the monastery then left empty and converted the lay brothers\\\\\\' quarters to new uses. At some houses, such as Sawley Abbey in Lancashire, a series of comfortable chambers for the use of monastic officials or guests were built; elsewhere, such as Hailes Abbey in Gloucestershire, the west range was turned into a private dwelling of great elegance for the abbot. The ruins of the west range at Netley are too fragmentary to be sure of their purpose in the latter part of the medieval period. All the buildings around the cloister were finished in the fourteenth century. There were subsequently few major structural changes during the monastic period aside from the re-vaulting of the south transept of the church at the end of the fifteenth century. It is likely, however, that there were many internal changes to match the rising standards of living during the later Middle Ages (as seen at Cleeve Abbey in Somerset) that have left no evidence on the surviving remains. \\n Precinct \\n A stone building to the east of the main complex is thought to have been the abbot\\\\\\'s house. It contains two levels of vaulted apartments consisting of two halls, bedchambers, a private chapel and service rooms. The upper level was reached by an external staircase, which allowed this floor to be used independently if needed. The central core of the monastery was surrounded by a precinct containing an outer (public) courtyard and an inner (private) courtyard, gardens, barns, guesthouses for travellers, stables, fishponds, the home farm and industrial buildings. The site was defended by a high bank and moat, part of which remains east of the abbey. Entrance was strictly controlled by an outer and inner gatehouse. A chapel, known as the capella ante portas (Latin for chapel outside the gates) was placed by the outer gatehouse for the use of travellers and the local population. Of the precinct buildings, only the abbot\\\\\\'s house, the moat and the fishponds have left visible remains. Netley\\\\\\'s fresh water was supplied by two aqueducts which ran for several miles east and west of the abbey, up into the areas of modern Southampton and Eastleigh. The remains of the eastern aqueduct, now known as Tickleford Gully, can be seen in Wentworth Gardens, Southampton. \\n Monastic history \\n Henry III added to the endowment left by Peter des Roches, donating farmland, urban property in Southampton and elsewhere, and spiritual revenues from churches. By 1291, taxation returns show that the abbey had a clear annual revenue of a comfortable income. However, shortly afterwards a period of bad management resulted in the abbey accruing substantial debts, and it was soon almost bankrupt. In 1328 the government was forced to appoint an administrator, John of Mere, to address the crisis. Despite forcing the abbot to apply revenues to debt repayment and to sell many of the estates, the operation was only partly successful. Ten years later the abbey was again appealing to the king for help with a disastrous financial situation. The monks blamed their problems on the cost of providing hospitality to the many travellers by sea, and the king\\\\\\'s sailors who landed at the abbey. The king provided some small grants enabling the abbey to overcome its difficulties but the property sales meant that the abbey\\\\\\'s income never recovered and it settled into what has been described as genteel poverty. Nevertheless, Netley remained a much respected institution by its neighbours until the end of its life as a monastery. It was not known for scholarship, wealth, or particular fervour, but it was highly regarded for its generosity to travellers and sailors, and for the devout lives (\"by Raporte of good Religious conversation\") led by its monks. The abbot was summoned on many occasions to sit in Parliament  with fellow prelates in the House of Lords as one of the Lords Spiritual. Surviving reports suggest the abbey had a peaceful and scandal-free domestic life. \\n A surviving book \\n It is not a unique case among English medieval monasteries that almost nothing has survived of what must have been a number of books owned by the house as such or in the keeping of individual monks. These would include at least a small library with biblical texts, spiritual works and perhaps some books on practical subjects, bearing in mind that the management of the abbey plant would have been a considerable challenge. Furthermore, the celebration of the liturgy for a large part of the day and night would necessitate texts for the different participants, who as monks were for the most part not spectators but active participants, some of them with particular roles. Current scholarship has identified a single book as having belonged to Netley Abbey; it is now conserved as Arundel Ms. 69 in the British Library, London. The volume has an inscription, added in the 15th century on folio 265v: \"Codex iste pertinet ad domum sancte Marie de Netteley\" (\"This codex (i.e. a book not a scroll) belongs to the house of Saint Mary of Netteley\"). The volume itself is a Latin manuscript executed in the 13th century, a copy of Roger of Hoveden\\\\\\'s Chronica (\"Chronicles\").   Roger (died c. 1201) was an English historian of the reigns of  Henry II and  Richard I particularly important for his account of the years Little is known in detail about his life, but he may have been a priest and was a courtier to  Henry II, and accompanied  Richard I to the Holy Land on the Third Crusade and served as a local justice in the north of England, and more generally as a negotiator between the crown and various barons and monastic houses. \\n Dissolution \\n In 1535 the abbey\\\\\\'s income was assessed in the Valor Ecclesiasticus, Henry VIII\\\\\\'s general survey of Church finances prior to the plunder, at gross, net, which meant the following year that it came under the terms of the First Suppression Act, Henry\\\\\\'s initial move in the Dissolution of the Monasteries. At the beginning of the following year, the king\\\\\\'s commissioners, Sir James Worsley, John Paulet, George Paulet and William Berners, delivered a report to the government on the monasteries of Hampshire which provides a snapshot of Netley on the eve of the Dissolution. The commissioners noted that Netley was inhabited by seven monks, all of them priests, and the abbey was: A hedde house of Monkes of thordre of Cisteaux, beinge of large buyldinge and situate upon the Ryvage of the Sees. To the Kinge\\\\\\'s Subjects and Strangers travelinge the same Sees great Relief and Comforte. James Worsley In addition to the monks, Netley was home to and officials of the abbey, plus two Franciscan friars of the strict Observant part of that order who had been put into the abbot\\\\\\'s custody by the king, presumably for opposing his religious policies. The royal officers also found plate and jewels (these were certainly objects for worship, such as reliquaries or crosses) in the treasury worth \"ornaments\" worth and agricultural produce and animals worth The abbey\\\\\\'s debts were moderate at Abbot Thomas Stevens and his seven monks were forced to surrender their house to the king in the summer of 1536.  Abbot Thomas Stevens and six of his seventh opted to resign and become a secular  Southampton Water to join their mother house of Beaulieu. Abbot Stevens was appointed Abbot of Beaulieu in 1536 and administered it for two years until Beaulieu in turn was forced to surrender to the king in April 1538. The monks received pensions after the fall of Beaulieu; Abbot Thomas ended his days as treasurer of Salisbury Cathedral, and died in 1550. \\n Country house \\n Following the dissolution of Netley, on 3 August 1536, King Henry granted the abbey buildings and some of its estates to Sir William Paulet, his Lord Treasurer and subsequently Marquess of Winchester. As soon as he took over, Sir William started the process of turning the abbey into a palace suitable for one of the most important politicians in England. He converted the nave of the church into his great hall, kitchens and service buildings, the transepts and crossing became a series of luxurious apartments for his personal use, the presbytery was retained as the chapel of the mansion. The monks\\\\\\' dormitory became the long gallery of the mansion and the latrine block became several grand chambers. He demolished the south range and refectory and built a new one with a central turreted gatehouse to provide the appropriate seigneurial emphasis needed for a classic Tudor courtyard house. He likewise demolished the cloister walks to make a central courtyard for his house and placed a large fountain in the centre. The precinct buildings were demolished to create formal gardens and terraces. His eventual successor William Paulet, 4th Marquess of Winchester (c.1560-1629) of Basing House, Hampshire, on encountering financial difficulties, sold Basing and Hound in 1602 to Edward Seymour, 1st Earl of Hertford (1539-1621), of Tottenham House in Wiltshire, who used it as a residence, and died there in 1621. His eventual descendant William Seymour, 3rd Duke of Somerset (1652-1671) died aged 19 without progeny when his title passed by law to his heir male but his unentailed estates including Netley and Hound, passed top his sister Elizabeth Seymour, wife of Thomas Bruce, 2nd Earl of Ailesbury (1656-1741), who sold Netley in 1676 to Henry Somerset, 3rd Marquess of Worcester (1629-1700), later Duke of Beaufort. Theophilus Hastings, 7th Earl of Huntingdon, inhabited the abbey until the close of the seventeenth century. \\n Romantic ruin \\n Around 1700, Netley Abbey came into the hands of Sir Berkeley Lucy (also spelled Sir \"Bartlet\"), who decided in 1704 to demolish the by now unfashionable house in order to sell the materials. Sir Berkeley made an agreement with a Southampton builder, Mr Walter Taylor, to take down the former church. However, during the course of the demolition, the contractor was killed by the fall of tracery from the west window of the church and the scheme was halted. The abbey was subsequently abandoned and allowed to decay. In the 1760s Thomas Dummer, who owned estates in the area, moved the north transept to his estate at Cranbury Park near Winchester where it can be still be seen as a folly in the gardens of the house (at By the second half of the eighteenth century, the abbey, by then partially roofless and overgrown with trees and ivy, had become a famous ruin that attracted the attention of artists, dramatists and poets. In the nineteenth century, Netley became a popular tourist attraction (the novelist Jane Austen was among those who visited) and steps were taken to conserve the ruins. Archaeological excavations directed by Charles Pink and Reverend Edmund Kell took place in 1860. During the same period the owners decided to remove many of the Tudor additions to the building to create a more medieval feel to the site, resulting in the loss of much evidence of the abbey\\\\\\'s post-Dissolution story. In 1922, the abbey was passed into state care by the then owner, Tankerville Chamberlayne, one time M.P. for Southampton. Conservation and archaeological work on the abbey has continued. \\n In literature and art \\n Soon after the abbey had been allowed to fall into ruin, it began to attract the attention of artists and writers, and was a popular subject throughout the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. In 1755, the antiquarian Horace Walpole praised the ruins in his letters following a visit with the poet Thomas Gray, claiming they were \"In short, not the ruins of Netley, but of Paradise\". In 1764, George Keate wrote The Ruins of Netley Abbey, A poem, which showed a romantic appreciation of the ruins and evoked sympathy for the life formerly led there by the monks. He prefaced his poem with a heartfelt plea for the preservation of the remains.  Keate was followed by other romantic poets including William Sotheby (Ode, Netley Abbey, Midnight, 1790). Sotheby\\\\\\'s view of the abbey was gothic; he peoples the ruins with spectral processions and ghostly Cistercians. Nor was he the only one; in 1795 Richard Warner wrote a potboiler entitled Netley Abbey, a Gothic Story in two volumes, featuring skullduggery at the abbey during the middle ages. Dark deeds before the Dissolution also appeared in the section of Richard Harris Barham\\\\\\'s Ingoldsby Legends covering Netley. This complex satire pokes fun at the medieval church and the monks (whom he accuses of having walled up an erring nun in one of the vaults and ensuring God\\\\\\'s revenge upon them) and the tourists who crowded contemporary Netley, while at the same time showing appreciation of the beauty of the ruins. Netley Abbey, an Operatic Farce, by William Pearce, was first performed in 1794 at Covent Garden. The set of the first production featured an elaborate mockup of the abbey ruins seen in the moonlight. The earliest surviving depiction of the abbey is by the engravers Samuel and Nathaniel Buck, who specialised in landmarks and great ruins. Their engraving (1733) shows the church of the abbey much as it is today, with the exception of the high vault of the south transept still present. The picture has notable errors and was clearly done from memory and rough sketches. The most famous artist to paint the ruins was John Constable, whose 1833 painting of the west end of the church shows it among trees. \\n Condition \\n The visitor today will find the shell of the church and monastic buildings around the cloister plus the abbot\\\\\\'s house. Little of the post-Dissolution mansion remains aside from the south range, foundations, alterations to the medieval structure in red Tudor brick and traces of the formal gardens. In most places the abbey stands close to its original height. The sacristy/library, the south transept chapels, the treasury, the reredorter undercroft and the lower floor of the abbot\\\\\\'s house still have their vaults intact. Medieval heraldic polychrome tiles found on the site can be seen in the sacristy, and Henry III\\\\\\'s foundation stone remains in the church. The abbey ruins are set in wooded parkland to the west of the village of Netley and constitute the most complete surviving Cistercian monastery in southern England. The site is maintained by English Heritage, and is open to the public. Netley is an Ancient Monument protected by law. \\n Events \\n During the summer months the abbey is occasionally host to events such as open-air theatre and was the site of a flashmob wedding on 25 June 2011. \\n 2018 closure \\n Netley Abbey was closed to the public in June 2018 due to safety concerns. English Heritage has taken the decision after scaffolding set up in the nave for conservation work was found to \"fall far short\" of expected standards. \\n Walter Taylor \\n Over the years several legends have grown up around the abbey, the best attested of which is that of Walter Taylor, the builder contracted to demolish the church. Legend has it that before starting the work he was warned in a dream that he would be punished if he committed sacrilege by damaging the building. The story is recounted by the eighteenth-century antiquary Browne Walters: The earl (sic), it is said, made a contract with a Mr. Walter Taylor, a builder of Southampton, for the complete demolition of the Abbey; it being intended by Taylor to employ the materials in erecting a town house at Newport and other buildings. After making this agreement, however, Taylor dreamed that, as he was pulling down a particular window, one of the stones forming the arch fell upon him, and killed him. His dream impressed him so forcibly that he mentioned the circumstance to a friend, who is said to have been the father of the well-known Dr. Isaac Watts, and in some perplexity asked his advice. His friend thought it would be the safest course for him to have nothing to do with the affair, respecting which he had been so alarmingly forewarned, and endeavoured to persuade him to desist from his intention. Taylor, however, at last decided upon paying no attention to his dream, and accordingly began his operations for the pulling down of the building; in which he had not proceeded far, when, as he was assisting at the work, the arch of one of the windows, but not the one he had dreamed of (which was the east window still standing), fell upon his head and fractured his skull. It was thought at first that the wound would not prove mortal; but it was aggravated through the unskilfulness of the surgeon, and the man died. Walters \\n Blind Peter \\n Another local legend states that during the Dissolution of the Monasteries the abbey\\\\\\'s treasure was hidden down a secret tunnel with a lone monk to guard it. After many years of searching a treasure hunter called Slown is said to have entered an underground passage he had discovered only to return a few moments later screaming, \"In the name of God, block it up,\" before dropping dead. \\n The walled up nun \\n The story of the nun walled up in a small room recounted in Richard Barham\\\\\\'s The Ingoldsby Legends was a creation of the author and has no basis in fact or genuine folklore, as the author himself admits with a smile in his notes to the poem, attributing his story to one James Harrison: a youthful but intelligent cab driver of Southampton, who \"well remembers to have heard his grandmother say that \\\\\\'Somebody told her so\\\\\\'.\" Harris Barham\\'b\\' \\n Lydia Ainsworth \\n Early life and education \\n Ainsworth was born in Toronto to a singer-songwriter father and a set designer mother. She began learning cello at age 10 and attended the Etobicoke School of the Arts as a teenager. She completed a Bachelor\\\\\\'s degree in music composition at McGill University and was named an Emerging Artist by the Canada Council for the Arts in 2008. She moved to New York City to complete a Master\\\\\\'s degree in music composition on a grant at New York University. \\n Career \\n Aisworth began composing for student films while at McGill University, and in 2011 she composed the score for the film The Woods directed by Matthew Lessner. She began recording her first album, Right from Real, in her New York apartment, but completed the album in Toronto. The album was released in September 2014 by Montreal-based independent label Arbutus Records; in 2015 it was a nominee for the Juno Award for the Electronic Album of the Year. In 2016, she was named by CBC Music as one of \"6 Canadian female producers you need to know.\" Ainsworth released a video, \"Afterglow\" in February, 2017, in advance of her second album, Darling of the Afterglow, which was released in March that year.\\'b\" \\n Alpheus heterochaelis \\n Description \\n The bigclaw snapping shrimp has a small rostrum and no spines on the edge of its carapace. The big claw or chela which gives it its common name can be either the right or left claw and is disproportionally large, measuring half the length of the body. It has a deep notch on either side beneath the finger joint. The other claw is unmodified and of normal size. The bigclaw is the largest species of snapping shrimp in its home range, growing to a maximum length of 5.5 centimetres but most adults are considerably smaller than this. Its colour is a translucent dark green with orange and blue tips to the uropods. \\n Distribution and habitat \\n The bigclaw snapping shrimp is found in tropical and semitropical waters in the Gulf of Mexico, the West Indies, Bermuda, and the western Atlantic Ocean from Cape Hatteras south to Florida and Brazil. It lives close to the seabed in shallow waters favouring reefs, seagrass meadows, salt marshes and muddy areas. It often conceals itself in a natural aperture during the day though it is unclear whether it can dig itself a burrow. \\n Biology \\n The bigclaw snapping shrimp produces a loud, staccato concussive noise with its snapping claw. The sound is produced when the claw snaps shut at great speed creating a high-speed water jet. This creates a small, short-lived cavitation bubble and it is the immediate collapse of this bubble that creates the sound. A spark is formed at the same time. The snapping noise serves to deter predators and to stun prey, and is also used for display purposes. The bigclaw snapping shrimp feeds on worms, small crustaceans and fish such as gobies and pearlfish. It is itself eaten by the weakfish (Cynoscion regalis). It is often associated with the black-clawed mud crab (Panopeus herbstii), sharing the crab\\'s burrow and remaining uneaten, even though this crab eats similar-sized shrimps of other species. Bigclaw snapping shrimps mostly live as monogamous pairs. The female is only receptive for a short time just after moulting. The eggs hatch about four weeks after being laid and the larvae do not feed, but instead rely on their egg yolks. They develop very quickly and pass through their three larval stages in about five days. The newly metamorphosed juvenile shrimps have equal sized chelae; one of these enlarges at a later stage.\"b\\' \\n Delicate AWOL \\n Sound and influences \\n Between the formation and demise of the band, Delicate AWOL\\\\\\'s sound underwent an extensive transformation. Originally favouring a harsh, guitar-orientated urban indie sound, the band passed through a more ethereal art rock mid-period and ultimately arrived at a more groove-orientated, jazz-influenced sound incorporating electronica, elements of Brazilian music and electric-period Miles Davis. At various times, the band cited influences including Mogwai, Cocteau Twins, Low, art rock from 1990s Chicago (such as Tortoise and The For Carnation) and Montreal (Godspeed You! Black Emperor) and 1970s Britain (King Crimson). Reviewers sometimes compared them to the bands Stereolab, Bardo Pond, Movietone, Pram, Tarwater and Parlour. \\n Formation and early lineups \\n Caroline Ross had played guitar or bass in various London bands during the 1990s, latterly teaming up with fine artist Jim Brook (who also played music under the name of Jim Version). The duo\\\\\\'s first band was Ripley, soon renamed Vaughan. By 1998, after various line-up changes, this had metamorphosed into Delicate AWOL, in which Ross (vocals, guitar, flute) and Version (guitar) were joined by Yann Faurie (drums) and Valerie Lockett from London (bass guitar). Ensconcing themselves in Toby Robinson\\\\\\'s Moat Studios in Stockwell, the band began to work on refining their sound. In 1999, Ross and Version set up the Day Release record label to release their own future recordings and those of others. (Releases on the label eventually included material by Robinson\\\\\\'s Krautrock project The Nazgul, singer songwriter David Hurn, Godspeed You! Black Emperor spinoff Trois Pistoles, The Monsoon Bassoon, and many others). One of the first Day Release releases, in mid-1999, was Delicate AWOL\\\\\\'s debut EP Random Blinking Lights. At this stage, the band was still very much in an art-rock/indie rock vein, sporting an abrasive edge, relatively simple rhythms, Version\\\\\\'s heavily distorted guitar and Ross singing in an incantatory tone reminiscent of Patti Smith. The band also developed a short-lived all-instrumental alter ego called Forty Shades Of Black, releasing a simultaneous single called \"Belisha\". A tour of England and Scotland to promote both of the new releases ended with some changes to the line-up in Scotland with Faurie and Lockett leaving the group to work on other projects. Delicate AWOL completed their tour obligations playing the final gig of the tour at King Tut\\\\\\'s in Glasgow as a two-piece of Ross and Version. \\n Stabilising the line-up, and Our Genome \\n Heartened by the positive audience reception in Glasgow, Ross and Version returned to London and began recording their debut album, Our Genome, as a duo. When Michael Donnelly (bass) and Tom Page (drums) were recruited into the band mid-sessions Ross and Version became so enthused with their new contributions that they scrapped the original version of Our Genome altogether and began rewriting and recording the album from scratch. (Some tracks from the original Our Genome sessions surfaced later as EP tracks, and a few complete copies of the shelved album are in private hands). In the summer of 2000, Delicate AWOL released the \"Hurray for Sugar\" single - a delicate, whispering song which clearly indicated that the band had moved on from their more abrasive beginnings. Tom Page\\\\\\'s percussionist brother Ben Page was added to the line-up, and Ross added more instruments to her live armoury (including ocarina, melodica and assorted small percussion instruments). The band\\\\\\'s next release was part of the Day Release \"Four Seasons Singles Club\", a series of releases each of which featured three EPs from three different artists: Delicate AWOL contributed three tracks to the \"Autumn\" issue. In November 2000, the band performed at the fourth Terrastock festival in Seattle, Washington State, USA. Our Genome was released by Day Release Records in the spring of 2001. It displayed a much-evolved band sound more cohesive and dynamic, and considerably quieter, with added instrumentation (including horns) on several tracks. Demonstrating the band\\\\\\'s intention to keep moving, it featured none of the early singles and no previously released tracks. The band were now heading in a post-rock direction, with vocals assuming more of an ensemble/instrumental quality and various experiments with textures. By this time, Delicate AWOL had also established themselves as a significant band within the London math rock scene, sharing stages and audiences with bands such as The Monsoon Bassoon, Rothko, The Shrubbies (featuring future North Sea Radio Orchestra members), Geiger Counter, Billy Mahonie and others. For a while, they also ran their own club night, \"Everywhere Is Mouse\", in the basement of Helter Skelter music bookstore in Denmark Street. The event attracted performers including The Monsoon Bassoon, Stewart Lee and Al Murray (performing as part of a band), Keith Burstein and others. Adding trumpeter Jo Wright to the line-up, Delicate AWOL toured America during the summer of 2001 and returned to play the fifth Terrastock festival (this time in Boston) in October. The Driesh EP, released in autumn 2001 (with the band\\\\\\'s elegiac set-closer \"Dust\" as the lead track) ended the band\\\\\\'s middle period. One track - the instrumental \"Evergreen China Prairie Tribunal\" - pointed the way forward towards the next phase. \\n Heart Drops from the Great Space \\n As a live act, Delicate AWOL were becoming more and more influenced by the lighter and more fluid rhythms of jazz, with the rhythm section now embracing spacious groove and Latin-inspired rhythms, Wright improvising complex trumpet lines and Ben Page playing analogue-style synthesizers as well as percussion. Although Version\\\\\\'s overdriven guitar maintained a link to the band\\\\\\'s art rock past, Ross was now a committed multi-instrumentalist with a vocal style that had begun to incorporate folk, Latin and swing stylings. In 2002, the band signed a deal with the revived indie label Fire Records and wound up Day Release Records in order to concentrate on band work (David Hurn also made the crossing from Day Release to Fire). The band\\\\\\'s second album, Heart Drops From The Great Space was released on Fire Records the same year and was accompanied by the 12-inch vinyl EP Time And Motion Studies Deep Underground. Both clearly demonstrated the evolution of the live band, who also cemented their links with Rothko by providing most of the instrumentation on the 2004 Rothko album A Continual Search for Origins. \\n Relocation and split \\n In 2003, Delicate AWOL relocated from London to the village of Huntly (in Aberdeenshire, Scotland). This was apparently an attempt to escape urban pressures, to liberate their musical creativity (including Version\\\\\\'s burgeoning career as a sound engineer and producer) and to get more involved in both community activity and the band\\\\\\'s other love - visual art. In fact, the move led to the slow disintegration of the band. While maintaining her links with Delicate AWOL, Jo Wright had already left the active lineup: she was shortly followed by bass player Donnelly.  In 2005 the Page brothers also left the band and returned to London. Donelly was replaced for a while by the Aberdeen-based Philip Johnston (who also doubled on flute and saxophone). A final version of Delicate AWOL performed at the Tunnels club in Aberdeen on 10 April 2005, with a line-up of Ross, Version, Neil Scollay (drums), Danny Ashton (guitar), Kate Mutsaers and Martha Buckingham (vocals) The same lineup (plus Marian Nagahiro) performed at Forgue Kirk near Huntly on 30 April 2005. Ross and Version quietly dissolved Delicate AWOL shortly afterwards, having found that their new compositions were unsuited to the restrictions of a settled band. \\n Post-split activities \\n Ross and Version continued to work together for a few years as the avant-folk/experimental duo Tells before going their separate ways. Songs originally conceived for the third Delicate AWOL album appeared on Tells\\\\\\' lone 2006 album Hope Your Wounds Heal. While still with Tells, Caroline Ross contributed to two tracks on Susumu Yokota\\\\\\'s 2005 album Distant Sounds of Summer as well as recording a collaboration album with Rothko called A Place Between (credited to Rothko/Caroline Ross). Jim Version - reverting to his original surname of Brooks - would subsequently relocate to Cheltenham, where he remained involved in art and music. Returning to London and the south-east, Ross joined the live band of experimental folk musician Woodpecker Wooliams in 2009, singing and playing flute, glockenspiel, omnichord, cheese-grater and other instrument and items. Regarding the other former members of Delicate AWOL, Michael Donelly would return to London and continue as part of the second and third lineups of Rothko, while Tom and Ben Page would form the improvising instrumental duo Rocketnumbernine (working both solo and with artists such as Neneh Cherry). Under her married name of Downs, Jo Wright went on to work with The Sweet Believers and assorted jazz orchestras.\\'b\\' \\n Felix Meritis \\n Felix Meritis (\"Happy through Merit\") is the name of a building  on the Keizersgracht in Amsterdam. Since 1988 The Felix Meritis Foundation has been located in the building as a European centre for art, culture and science. \\n History \\n It was built according to a winning design by the architect Jacob Otten Husly for the new society called Felix Meritis established in 1776 for Music, Drawing, Physics, Commerce and Literature in the modern neo-classical style. Husly had won a similar design contest for the city hall of Groningen in the previous year. The building itself was meant to exemplify the Enlightenment ideals the society stood for. The classical temple with its colossal Corinthian pilasters and pediment represent the society\\\\\\'s five departments with five sculptures representing the visual arts and architecture, literature, trade, natural sciences and music. The interior includes original 18th-century features such as the central staircase, the oval concert hall (renowned for its acoustics) and the domed roof - underneath which there used to be an astronomical observatory.  On 31 October 1788 the building of the same name opened its doors. The society focused on the promotion of arts and sciences in a broader sense than the artists collectives popular at the time. Husly was himself a board member of the Amsterdam city drawing academy Stadstekenacademie, that had close contacts with the Oeconomischen Tak van de Hollandsche Maatschappij der Wetenschappen (economics branch of the Hollandsche Maatschappij der Wetenschappen, which met in the Trippenhuis). The society was abolished in 1888. Felix oval concert hall was the main music hall in Amsterdam until late into the 19th century and enjoyed a great international reputation. Many famous musicians performed there, including Robert and Clara Schumann, Camille Johannes Brahms and Julius The orchestra of Felix Meritis was regarded as the best of the Netherlands and accompanied many Dutch premieres, directed by conductors such as Johannes Bernardus van Bree. Thus, Ninth Symphony and Symphonie fantastique had their Dutch premiere  in the concert hall of Felix Meritis. The small hall of the Concertgebouw is a replica of this concert hall. \\n Twentieth century \\n When the old Felix Meritis society was dissolved in 1888, the printing company Holdert & Co., which became one of Amsterdam\\\\\\'s largest printing companies, moved into the building. In 1932 part of the building was destroyed in a fire. After the Second World War the Communist Party of the Netherlands set up its headquarters in the building. From 1947 until 1981 its newspaper \\\\\\'De Waarheid\\\\\\' (\\\\\\'The Truth\\\\\\') rolled from the presses. In the 50s, Felix Meritis became the symbol of communism in the Netherlands. This image became especially embedded in the collective memory when the building was stormed on 4 November 1956, in response to the Soviet invasion of Hungary and its endorsement by the Dutch communist party. However, in the late sixties, Felix Meritis became a cradle of evenings for alternative youth, which were named Provadya. In 1969 the Shaffy Theater opened, which gained a reputation as a stopping place for the Dutch avant-garde, including Ramses Shaffy, Baal, Neerlands Hoop, Independent Theater and Hauser Orkater. \\n Centre for art, culture and science \\n In 1988, one hundred years after the old society was dissolved, The Felix Meritis foundation was re-established in the building as a European center for art, culture and science. Felix Meritis is an independent international meeting place and serves as director of the European public debate, cultural processes and international projects and exchanges. Felix Meritis presents itself as a knowledge institution and platform for European cultural dialogue and cultural-political issues. The motto of Felix Meritis is Connecting Cultures. In collaboration with partners from home and abroad Felix Meritis initiates projects such as A Soul for Europe, Amsterdam Forum, The People Network, Gulliver Connect, Amsterdam Summer University, Dare2Connect, The European House for Culture (Brussels), Night of Philosophy, Cafe Europa, The Globalization Lecture Foundation and Kuhnya. \\n Felix in de Steigers \\n In November 2014 the management company Amerborgh, owned by Alex Mulder purchased Felix Meritis from the city of Amsterdam. Amerborgh will start renovating the building in 2017. During 2015 en 2016 the building houses the temporary project in de providing space for art, theatre and several experimental cultural programmes until construction is under way.\\'b\\' \\n Mastaba \\n A mastaba or or pr-djt (meaning \"house of eternity\" or \"eternal house\" in Ancient Egyptian) is a type of ancient Egyptian tomb in the form of a flat-roofed, rectangular structure with inward sloping sides, constructed out of mud-bricks. These edifices marked the burial sites of many eminent Egyptians during Egypt\\\\\\'s Early Dynastic Period and Old Kingdom. In the Old Kingdom epoch, local kings began to be buried in pyramids instead of in mastabas, although non-royal use of mastabas continued for over a thousand years. Egyptologists call these tombs mastaba, from the Arabic word \"stone bench\". \\n History \\n The afterlife was an important part of Ancient Egyptian religion. This is reflected in their architecture and most prominently by the enormous amounts of time, money, and labour involved in the building of tombs. Ancient Egyptians believed the soul could live only if the body was preserved from corruption and depredation as well as fed. Starting in the Predynastic era and continuing into the later dynasties, the ancient Egyptians developed increasingly complex and effective methods for preserving and protecting the bodies of the dead. They buried their dead in pit graves dug out from the sand; the body placed on a mat, usually along with some items believed to help them in the afterlife. The first tomb structure which the Egyptians developed was the mastaba, composed of earthen bricks made from soil along the Nile. It provided better protection from scavenging animals and from grave robbers. As the remains were not in contact with the dry desert sand, natural mummification could not take place; therefore the Egyptians devised a system of artificial mummification. Until at least the Old Period or First Intermediate Period, only high officials and royalty would be buried in these mastabas. \\n Structure \\n The word \\\\\\'mastaba\\\\\\' comes from the Arabic word for a bench of mud. When seen from a distance, a flat-topped mastaba does resemble a bench. Historians speculate that the Egyptians may have borrowed architectural ideas from Mesopotamia, since at the time they were both building similar structures. The above-ground structure of a mastaba is rectangular in shape with inward-sloping sides and a flat roof. The exterior building materials were initially bricks made of the sun-dried mud readily available from the Nile River. Even after more durable materials such as stone came into use, all but the most important monumental structures were built from mudbricks. Mastabas were often about four times as long as they were wide, and many rose to at least 30 feet in height. They were oriented North-South, which the Egyptians believed was essential for access to the afterlife. The above-ground structure had space for a small offering chapel equipped with a false door. Priests and family members brought food and other offerings for the soul, or ba, of the deceased, which had to be maintained in order to continue to exist in the afterlife. Inside the mastaba, a deep chamber was dug into the ground and lined with stone and bricks. The burial chambers were cut deep, until they passed the bedrock, and were lined with wood.  A second hidden chamber called a serdab from the Persian word for \"cellar\", was used to store anything that may have been considered essential for the comfort of the deceased in the afterlife, such as beer, grain, clothes, and precious items. The mastaba housed a statue of the deceased that was hidden within the masonry for its protection. High up the walls of the serdab were small openings that would allow the ba to leave and return to the body (represented by the statue); Ancient Egyptians believed the ba had to return to its body or it would die.  These openings \"were not meant for viewing the statue but rather for allowing the fragrance of burning incense, and possibly the spells spoken in rituals, to reach the statue\". \\n Architectural evolution \\n The mastaba was the standard type of tomb in pre-dynastic and early dynastic Egypt for both the pharaoh and the social elite. The ancient  city of Abydos was the location chosen for many of the cenotaphs. The royal cemetery was at Saqqara, overlooking the capital of early times, Memphis. Mastabas evolved over the early dynastic period. During the 1st Dynasty, a mastaba was constructed simulating house plans of several rooms, a central one containing the sarcophagus and others surrounding it to receive the abundant funerary offerings. The whole was built in a shallow pit above which a brick superstructure covering a broad area. The typical 2nd and 3rd Dynasty mastabas was the \\\\\\'stairway mastaba\\\\\\', the tomb chamber of which sank deeper than before and was connected to the top with an inclined shaft and stairs. Even after pharaohs began to construct pyramids for their tombs in the 3rd Dynasty, members of the nobility continued to be buried in mastaba tombs. This is especially evident on the Giza Plateau, where at least 150 mastaba tombs have been constructed alongside the pyramids. In the 4th Dynasty (c. 2613 to 2494 BC), rock-cut tombs began to appear. These were tombs built into the rock cliffs in Upper Egypt in an attempt to further thwart grave robbers. Mastabas, then, were developed with the addition of offering chapels and vertical shafts. 5th Dynasty mastabas had elaborate chapels consisting of several rooms, columned halls and \\\\\\'serdab\\\\\\'. The actual tomb chamber was built below the south-end of mastaba, connected by a slanting passage to a stairway emerging in the center of a columned hall or court. Mastabas are still well attested in the Middle Kingdom. Here they had a revival. They were often solid structures with the decoration only on the outside.  By the time of the New Kingdom (which began with the 18th Dynasty around 1550 BC), \"the mastaba becomes rare, being largely superseded by the independent pyramid chapel above a burial chamber\".\\'b\\' \\n CRYPTREC \\n CRYPTREC is the Cryptography Research and Evaluation Committees set up by the Japanese Government to evaluate and recommend cryptographic techniques for government and industrial use. It is comparable in many respects to the European Union\\\\\\'s NESSIE project and to the Advanced Encryption Standard process run by NIST in the U.S.. \\n Comparison with NESSIE \\n There is some overlap, and some conflict, between the NESSIE selections and the CRYPTREC draft recommendations. Both efforts include some of the best cryptographers in the world therefore conflicts in their selections and recommendations should be examined with care. For instance, CRYPTREC recommends several 64 bit block ciphers while NESSIE selected none, but CRYPTREC was obliged by its terms of reference to take into account existing standards and practices, while NESSIE was not. Similar differences in terms of reference account for CRYPTREC recommending at least one stream cipher, RC4, while the NESSIE report specifically said that it was notable that they had not selected any of those considered. RC4 is widely used in the SSL/TLS protocols; nevertheless, CRYPTREC recommended that it only be used with 128-bit keys. Essentially the same consideration led to CRYPTREC\\\\\\'s inclusion of 160-bit message digest algorithms, despite their suggestion that they be avoided in new system designs. Also, CRYPTREC was unusually careful to examine variants and modifications of the techniques, or at least to discuss their care in doing so; this resulted in particularly detailed recommendations regarding them. \\n Responsibilities \\n It is also the organization providing technical evaluation and recommendations in regard to regulations implementing Japanese laws: examples include that on Electronic Signatures and Certification Services (Law 102 of FY2000, taking effect as from April 2001), the Basic Law on the Formulation of an Advanced Information and Telecommunications Network Society of 2000 (Law 144 of FY2000), and the Public Individual Certification Law of December 2002. Furthermore, CRYPTEC has responsibilities with regard to the Japanese contribution to the ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC27 standardization effort. \\n Selection \\n First release in 2003, many Japanese ciphers were selected for \"e-Government Recommended Ciphers List\"; CIPHERUNICORN-E (NEC), Hierocrypt-L1 (Toshiba), MISTY1 (Mitsubishi Electric) as 64 bit block ciphers, Camellia (Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, Mitsubishi Electric), CIPHERUNICORN-A (NEC), Hierocrypt-3 (Toshiba), SC2000(Fujitsu) as 128 bit block ciphers, MUGI, MULTI-S01 (Hitachi) as stream ciphers. Revised release in 2013, list was divided to three, \"e-Government Recommended Ciphers List\", \"Candidate Recommended Ciphers List\", and \"Monitored Ciphers List\". Most of Japanese ciphers listed in previous list (except for Camellia) have moved from \"Recommended Ciphers List\" to \"Candidate Recommended Ciphers List\". There were several new proposals like CLEFIA (Sony) as 128 bit block cipher, KCipher-2 (KDDI), Enocoro-128v2 (Hitachi) as stream ciphers, however, only KCipher-2 has been listed on \"e-Government Recommended Ciphers List\". The reason why most of Japanese ciphers have not been selected as \"Recommended Ciphers\" is not that these ciphers are unsafe, but that these ciphers are not widely used in commercial products, open-source projects, governmental systems, international standards. There is possibility that ciphers listed on \"Candidate Recommended Ciphers List\" will be moved to \"e-Government Recommended Ciphers List\" when they are used in many systems. In addition, 128 bit RC4 and SHA-1 are listed on \"Monitored Ciphers List\". These are unsafe and only permitted to keep compatibilities with old systems.\\'b\\' \\n Mark Dantonio \\n Early life \\n Dantonio was born in El Paso, Texas, to Justin and Maryan. Mark is of Italian descent. Dantonio\\\\\\'s Grandfather Frank D\\\\\\'antonio moved from Montenerodomo, Italy, to the United States - losing the apostrophe at Ellis Island in 1912. Mark was the second of four boys. When Mark was one, the family moved to Zanesville, Ohio, where Justin became the vice principal and basketball coach at Zanesville High School. Mark was an all-state safety at Zanesville. \\n College career \\n Dantonio attended the University of South Carolina and earned three letters as a defensive back for Coach Jim Carlen for the Gamecocks 1976-78. He earned a bachelor\\\\\\'s degree in education from South Carolina in 1979. Dantonio later earned a master\\\\\\'s degree in education from Ohio University in 1980. \\n Early coaching career \\n Dantonio began his coaching career at Ohio University, where he was a graduate assistant.  In 1981, he made his first stop in the Big Ten Conference when he moved on to Purdue University as a graduate assistant. He spent two years, in 1983 and 1984, as a graduate assistant at Ohio State University  under head coach Earle Bruce. In 1986, he began a five-year stint on Jim Tressel\\\\\\'s staff at Youngstown State University as a defensive secondary coach.  In 1990, Dantonio led the Penguins\\\\\\' defense to an record and a #2 ranking nationally.  Glen Mason hired Dantonio in 1991 to be the defensive secondary coach for the Kansas Jayhawks. When Nick Saban was hired at Michigan State in 1995, he hired Dantonio to join his staff in East Lansing where he remained even after Saban left for LSU.  After Bobby Williams was named head coach in 1999 following Saban\\\\\\'s departure, Dantonio was promoted to associate head coach where he remained through the 2000 season. At Ohio State in 2001, Dantonio reunited with his former Youngstown State boss and good friend Jim Tressel when he opted out of East Lansing to serve as defensive coordinator at Ohio State University for three seasons.  His defense became known as one of the stingiest in the country. During the Buckeyes\\\\\\' 2002 National Championship season, Ohio State ranked second nationally in scoring defense and third in rushing defense. For his efforts, Dantonio was named a 2002 finalist for the Broyles Award, given annually to the nation\\\\\\'s top college football assistant coach. In the 2003 season, his defense ranked number one in the country in rushing defense and ninth in total defense, which led the Buckeyes to an record and #4 national ranking.  Six Buckeye defenders were named first team All-Big Ten during Dantonio\\\\\\'s tenure. Thirteen were drafted into the NFL, including two first round picks in Chris Gamble and Will Smith. \\n Cincinnati \\n Dantonio was named head coach at Cincinnati on December 23, 2003. He became the first head coach in 23 years to lead the school to a winning season in his first season at UC. The Bearcats\\\\\\' record included a record in Conference USA, which was good enough for a second-place finish. The Bearcats finished the season on a winning note with a win over Marshall in the PlainsCapital Fort Worth Bowl.  During Dantonio\\\\\\'s time at UC, he led the Bearcats to a bowl game victory and directed the team\\\\\\'s transition into the Big East Conference. As head coach, Dantonio had 15 players earn all-conference honors and 25 received conference academic recognition. \\n Michigan State \\n Mark Dantonio became the 24th head coach at Michigan State on November 27, 2006. Upon his arrival, Dantonio planned to return the Spartans to a more traditional philosophy on offense and defense, eliminating the spread offense and the \"bandit\" linebacker/safety position used under previous head coach John L. Smith. \\n 2007 season \\n Dantonio began his Michigan State career well at Spartan Stadium when on April 21, 2007, Michigan State drew over 25,000 fans to watch the team\\\\\\'s spring scrimmage game. The white team, led by sophomore quarterback Connor Dixon, defeated junior quarterback Brian Hoyer and the green team by a score of During the game, Dantonio was seen behind the line of scrimmage watching and coaching the action. Dantonio won his first game at Michigan State on September 1, 2007, when the Spartans defeated the UAB Blazers, His first season at Michigan State was the school\\\\\\'s most successful since 2003. Dantonio\\\\\\'s Spartans went losing all five games by seven points or fewer, and were bowl eligible for the first time in four years. However, the Spartans lost to Boston College in the Champs Sports Bowl in Orlando on December 28. \\n 2008 season \\n Dantonio\\\\\\'s second season at MSU began with a loss at Cal, after which the Spartans came home and won six straight games against Eastern Michigan, Florida Atlantic, Notre Dame, Indiana, Iowa, and Northwestern. The victories propelled Michigan State into the top 25. Following a lopsided loss to the Ohio State Buckeyes, the Spartans beat Michigan, winning in Ann Arbor for the first time since 1990. Michigan State won its final two home games against Wisconsin and Purdue before losing to Penn State in Happy Valley. A win against Penn State would have resulted in Michigan State splitting the Big Ten Conference title with Ohio State. The nine regular season wins were Michigan State\\\\\\'s most since 1999. Michigan State finished third in the conference and was invited to play Georgia in the Capital One Bowl. Michigan State lost the game, finishing the season \\n 2009 season \\n Dantonio\\\\\\'s third season, 2009, was disappointing in performance and off-the-field issues. The team lost five games (Central Michigan, at Notre Dame, Iowa, at Minnesota, Texas Tech) in which they held the lead in the fourth quarter, leading to a disappointing record. \\n 2010 season \\n On September 19, 2010, just hours after a stunning fake field goal touchdown pass gave MSU a overtime victory over Notre Dame, Dantonio checked himself into a hospital after noticing chest pains. He later suffered a heart attack. He had a stent implanted in a blocked artery near his heart. His doctor stated that the damage was minimal and that Dantonio was expected to make a full recovery. Offensive coordinator Don Treadwell became acting head coach while Dantonio recovered. On September 30, after Dantonio had stated that he would be coaching the next game from the press box and just two days before Michigan State played Wisconsin, Dantonio was admitted back into the hospital as a blood clot was found in his leg. Dantonio had to watch the game from his hospital room. He was reportedly released from Sparrow Hospital around noon on October 4, 2010. On October 9, Dantonio coached his first game since his heart attack against rival Michigan. Michigan State won the game, in Ann Arbor. The Spartans under Dantonio continued to win and on November 20 reached on the season, winning all home games for the first time during his tenure. It was just the third time in school history that Michigan State had won 10 or more games in a season, the other two seasons being those of 1965 and 1999. On November 27, 2010, Dantonio\\\\\\'s Spartans defeated Penn State in Happy Valley to finish the season and clinch a share of the Big Ten Championship for the first time since 1990. On December 5, 2010, MSU announced that the Spartans were selected to play in the Capital One Bowl on January 1, 2011, against Alabama (ranked 15th in the BCS standings). The Spartans lost to the Crimson Tide and finished \\n 2011 season \\n In 2011, Michigan State had another successful year. The Spartans beat the Ohio State Buckeyes on the road for the first time since 1998, defeated arch-rival Michigan, and upset #6 Wisconsin on a last-second Hail Mary pass from Kirk Cousins to Keith Nichol. The Spartans finished in Big Ten play), earning the Legends Division championship and a place in the inaugural Big Ten Championship Game. After coming up just short in a rematch with Wisconsin, MSU was selected to play in the Outback Bowl against the Georgia Bulldogs. Dantonio led his team to a triple-overtime victory, his first bowl win at MSU. The Spartans reached the 11-win mark for the second straight season, finishing \\n 2012 season \\n In 2012, Dantonio led the Spartans to a record and a Buffalo Wild Wings Bowl win against Texas Christian University. The season started with promise, when preseason #13 Michigan State beat #24 Boise State; but two games later, the #10 Spartans lost to No. 20 Notre Dame, and went on to suffer four home losses in Big Ten play. The defense finished ninth in FBS points allowed, giving up just 16.3 points per game, but the offense struggled to score in several games.  MSU lost a decision to Michigan, despite the defense keeping the Wolverines out of the end zone the entire game. In May 2013, four months after the end of the 2012 season, Dantonio filmed himself at the Rose Bowl, predicting a successful 2013. \\n 2013 season \\n In 2013, Dantonio\\\\\\'s team finished in the regular season, including notable victories over Michigan and Nebraska to secure the third and final Legends Division title. On December 7, 2013, Michigan State, ranked #10 at the time of the game, defeated second-ranked Ohio State in the Big Ten Championship Game in Indianapolis. The win snapped Ohio State\\\\\\'s 24-game winning streak and sent Michigan State to its first Rose Bowl since the season. Michigan State was ranked #4 in the final BCS standings, its highest rank since the BCS\\\\\\'s inception. The Spartans defeated the fifth-ranked Stanford Cardinal in the 100th Rose Bowl Game on January 1, 2014. Dantonio was named Big Ten Football Coach of the Year. \\n 2014 season \\n In 2014, the Spartans finished the regular season finishing second in the East division with a record and ranked #8 in the nation. After losing to third-ranked Oregon in the season\\\\\\'s second game, the Spartans reeled off nine wins in their next 10 games. The Spartans earned a bid to the Goodyear Cotton Bowl Classic, part of the New Year\\\\\\'s Six bowls, and rallied from 20 points down in the fourth quarter to defeat fifth-ranked Baylor and finish the season with an overall record of The two losses came against Oregon and Ohio State, the teams that would play in the 2015 College Football Playoff National Championship. After the Cotton Bowl game, Dantonio said \"It\\\\\\'s a feeling of belief in each other, and that\\\\\\'s what we have. We don\\\\\\'t give up on each other. Consequently, they don\\\\\\'t give up in the game. We just keep playing hard. And that\\\\\\'s what we\\\\\\'ve been able to accomplish.\" \\n 2015 season \\n The 2015 season included an unlikely road win against then-#2 Ohio State, in which the Spartans played without starting quarterback Connor Cook. MSU also defeated Oregon, Penn State and Michigan to finish the regular season with an record, winning the East division with a record. Michigan State went on to beat an undefeated Iowa team in the Big Ten Championship Game, and ended the season ranked #3 in the nation. The #3 ranking earned the Spartans a spot in the NCAA College Football Playoff and the right to play #2 ranked Alabama on New Year\\\\\\'s Eve for a spot in the Championship game. They lost to eventual National Champion Alabama in the semi-final game, \\n 2016 season \\n In 2016, the Spartans had their worst season under Dantonio, going in Big Ten play and finishing the season at the program\\\\\\'s worst overall record in more than 30 years. \\n 2017 season \\n Michigan State ended the regular season The 2018 season featured upset wins over then-#7 Penn State at home and then-#7 Michigan on the road. Dantonio moved to all-time against in-state rival Michigan, as the Spartans forced five turnovers and defeated the Wolverines in Ann Arbor.  They finished the regular season at #16 in the CFP rankings and second in the B1G East Division The Spartans were selected to play the Washington State Cougars in the Holiday Bowl on December 28. The Spartans routed the Cougars, to finish the season giving Dantonio his sixth season of 10+ wins at MSU. \\n 2018 season \\n Michigan State started the season ranked #11 in the AP Top 25 Poll. They avoided an upset by unranked Utah State in the first game of the season, needing a late interception from junior linebacker Joe Bachie to preserve a victory. In the Spartans\\\\\\' second game of the season they would fall to Arizona State 16-13. Falling back in the polls, Michigan State then defeated Indiana The following week Dantonio\\\\\\'s team beat Central Michigan in their last non-conference game of the season. Michigan State was then upset at home by Northwestern the following week, sending them out of the AP top 25. The following week, the Spartans traveled to play a top 10 team in Penn State. Despite being heavy underdogs, Michigan State stunned Penn State with a last second touchdown pass to win On October 20, Michigan State hosted Michigan, and the Wolverine defense overpowered Michigan State The following week, the Spartans would rebound to beat Purdue by a score of MSU then traveled to Maryland and dominated the Terps After the win, MSU came home and lost to Ohio State, and then traveled to Lincoln and lost to Nebraska, In the final game of the season, the Spartans narrowly defeated Rutgers by a score of MSU finished the regular season and went on to lose to Oregon in the Redbox Bowl, The 2018 season featured a number of low-scoring games as MSU\\\\\\'s stout defense, ranked in the national top ten in six categories, was offset by an oft-struggling offense that finished in the bottom 20 nationally in six categories. \\n 2019 season \\n After winning its first two games, Michigan State was ranked #18 in the AP Poll. However, in their third game they fell at home to Arizona State, The Spartans had appeared to tie the game with a last-second field goal, but they were penalized for having 12 players on the field and forced to attempt the field goal again from five yards further, which missed. The following week, MSU defeated Northwestern to open its B1G schedule. This gave Dantonio his 110th win as Spartans head coach, surpassing Duffy Daugherty for the most football wins in school history. \\n Personal life \\n Mark Dantonio married his wife, Becky, in 1990. The couple have two daughters, Kristen and Lauren. He is a devout Roman Catholic.\\'b\" \\n Regina Scheyvens \\n Academic career \\n After a 1995 PhD titled  \\'A quiet strategies for the empowerment and development of rural women in the Solomon Islands\\'  at the Massey University, Scheyvens joined the staff, rising to full professor.\"b\" \\n Ballistic Trajectory Extended Range Munition \\n The Ballistic Trajectory Extended Range Munition (BTERM) was a failed program to develop a precision guided rocket-assisted 127 mm (5-inch) artillery shell for the U.S. Navy. The program was originally named the Autonomous Naval Support Round (ANSR) and was developed by Alliant Techsystems. The concept was similar to Raytheon\\'s Extended Range Guided Munition with several simplifications and a larger rocket motor. The warhead was based upon that in the AGM-88 HARM anti-radiation missile, and was guided through GPS; however, unlike the ERGM it was intended to fly a strictly ballistic trajectory. Both programs were cancelled in 2008.\"b\\' \\n Absorbing Markov chain \\n In the mathematical theory of probability, an absorbing Markov chain is a Markov chain in which every state can reach an absorbing state. An absorbing state is a state that, once entered, cannot be left. Like general Markov chains, there can be continuous-time absorbing Markov chains with an infinite state space. However, this article concentrates on the discrete-time discrete-state-space case. \\n Games of chance \\n Games based entirely on chance can be modeled by an absorbing Markov chain. A classic example of this is the ancient Indian board game Snakes and Ladders. The graph on the right plots the probability mass in the lone absorbing state that represents the final square as the transition matrix is raised to larger and larger powers. To determine the expected number of turns to complete the game, compute the vector t as described above and examine which is approximately 39.2. \\n Infectious disease clinic \\n The example of infectious disease testing, in either blood products or in medical clinics, is often taught as an example of an absorbing Markov chain. The public U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) model for HIV and for hepatitis B, for example, illustrates the property that absorbing Markov chains can lead to the detection of disease, versus the loss of detection through other means. In the standard CDC model, the Markov chain has five states, a state in which the individual is uninfected, then a state with infected but undetectable virus, a state with detectable virus, and absorbing states of having quit/been lost from the clinic, or of having been detected (the goal). The typical rates of transition between the Markov states are the probability p per unit time of being infected with the virus, w for the rate of window period removal (time until virus is detectable), q for quit/loss rate from the system, and d for detection, assuming a typical rate at which the health system administers tests of the blood product or patients in question. It follows that we can \"walk along\" the Markov model to identify the overall probability of detection for a person starting as undetected, by multiplying the probabilities of transition to each next state of the model as: . The subsequent total absolute number of false negative primary CDC then be the rate of tests, multiplied by the probability of reaching the infected but undetectable state, times the duration of staying in the infected undetectable state: .\\'b\\' \\n Michael Kamen \\n Early life \\n Michael Arnold Kamen was born in New York City, United States, the second of four sons. His father, Saul Kamen, was a dentist, and his mother, Helen, was a teacher. He was of Jewish heritage. While attending The High School of Music & Art in New York City, Michael Kamen became friends with Martin Fulterman (later known as Mark Snow, who composed the theme music for The X-Files among other projects). While studying the oboe, he formed a rock-classical fusion band called New York Rock & Roll Ensemble, together with classmates Fulterman and Dorian Rudnytsky along with Clifton Nivison and Brian Corrigan of Toms River, New Jersey. The group released five albums from 1968 to 1972 (Self-Titled, Reflections, Faithful Friends, Roll Over & Freedomburger). The group performed in white tie (not tuxedos), as typically worn by classical musicians. In the middle of the concert, Fulterman and Kamen would play an oboe duet. The group backed up friend and classmate Janis Ian in a concert at Alice Tully Hall in late 1967. After graduating from high school, Kamen attended The Juilliard School, in Manhattan, New York City. Kamen\\\\\\'s early work concentrated on ballets, before extending to Hollywood with the score for The Next Man in 1976, and then to pop and rock arranging, collaborating with Pink Floyd on their album, The Wall. \\n Career in popular music \\n Kamen became a highly sought-after arranger in the realms of pop and rock music. His contemporaries in this field included Academy Award winner Anne Dudley, Richard Niles, and Nick Ingman. His successes include his work with Pink Floyd, David Gilmour and Roger Waters (he is one of the few people invited to work with both former Pink Floyd members, even after their acrimonious split), as well as Queen (orchestration on Who Wants To Live Forever), Eric Clapton (on Edge of Darkness), Roger Daltrey, Aerosmith (live orchestral version of Dream On for MTV), Tom Petty, Bon Jovi, David Bowie, Bryan Ferry, Eurythmics, Rush, Metallica (on the song \"Nothing Else Matters\" and their live album, S&M), Def Leppard, Herbie Hancock, Tim Curry, The Cranberries, Bryan Adams, Jim Croce, Coldplay, Sting, Guns N\\\\\\' Roses (on their performance of November Rain on the MTV Video Music Awards) and Kate Bush. For Bush, Kamen delivered an orchestral backing for \"Moments of Pleasure\" from The Red Shoes album, substantially building upon a simple piano theme Bush had composed. In this instance and many others, he conducted the orchestra personally for the recording. In 1984, two years after moving to London, Kamen had similarly heightened the effect of a pop recording for the Eurythmics \"Here Comes the Rain Again\", that score relying as much on his compositional skills as his arranging talents. In 1990, Kamen joined many other guests for Roger Waters\\\\\\' performance of The Wall in Berlin, and led the National Philharmonic Orchestra during the 24 Nights sessions with Eric Clapton the following year. Lenny Kravitz recorded a cover of \"Fields of Joy\" on his 1991 CD Mama Said that Kamen had co-written with Hal Fredricks. In 2002, Kamen took part in the Concert for George as strings conductor. Kamen had a successful partnership with Bryan Adams and R.J. Lange composing scores and songs. The ballad \"(Everything I Do) I Do It for You\" for the 1991 film Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves was the number one song that year worldwide. Other songs were \"All for Love\" for the movie The Three Musketeers in 1993, and \"Have You Ever Really Loved a Woman?\" the song from the film Don Juan DeMarco, in 1994. \\n Film and television career \\n Kamen wrote eleven ballets, a saxophone concerto and an electric guitar concerto  (with Japanese guitarist Tomoyasu Hotei as a soloist, though originally performed by Eric Clapton). Additionally, he wrote a commissioned work, \"Quintet,\" for the Canadian Brass. He also provided scores for the films The Dead Zone, For Queen and Country, Polyester, Brazil, Someone To Watch Over Me, The Adventures of Baron Munchausen, The Three Musketeers, Highlander, X-Men, Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves, Licence to Kill, the Lethal Weapon series, the first three films of the Die Hard series, Mr. Holland\\\\\\'s Opus, The Iron Giant, Splitting Heirs, Frequency, Memento and many others. He also scored both the From the Earth to the Moon and Band of Brothers series on HBO. The trailer for the 2007 DreamWorks release Bee Movie, the 2008 Fox release Nim\\\\\\'s Island, the 2008 Disney/Pixar release WALL-E, and the 2014 Fox/DreamWorks release Mr. Peabody & Sherman  featured Kamen\\\\\\'s \"Central Services / The Office\" from his score to Brazil (1985). In television, Kamen composed music for two series of The Manageress produced by Glenn Wilhide at Zed Productions for Channel 4, but perhaps his best known work was on the 1985 BBC Television serial Edge of Darkness, on which he collaborated with Eric Clapton to write the score. The pair were awarded with a British Academy Television Award for Best Original Television Music for their work and performed the main movie theme with the National Philharmonic Orchestra at the Royal Albert Hall of London  in 1990 and 1991. In 1994, Kamen conducted an orchestration of The Who\\\\\\'s music for Roger Daltrey\\\\\\'s 50th birthday concert series entitled A Celebration: The Music of Pete Townshend and The Who which was subsequently released on CD and DVD. He also worked with heavy metal band Metallica, on a two-day concert that was held in Berkeley, California, with the San Francisco Symphony. A recording of the concert, titled S&M, debuted at #2 on the Billboard 200 and went multi-platinum in 2001. The same year Kamen and Metallica won a Grammy Award for Best Rock Instrumental Performance for one of S&M compositions, \"The Call of Ktulu\". Kamen was nominated for two Academy Awards and won three Grammy Awards, two Golden Globes, two Ivor Novello Awards, an Annie Award and an Emmy. \\n Later years \\n His involvement with Mr. Holland\\\\\\'s Opus, a film about a frustrated composer who finds fulfillment as a high school music teacher, led Kamen to create The Mr. Holland\\\\\\'s Opus Foundation in 1996. The foundation supports music education through the donation of new and refurbished musical instruments to underserved school and community music programs and individual students in the United States. In 2005 the foundation created an emergency fund for schools and students affected by Hurricane Katrina. In 1998, Kamen composed and conducted the soundtrack for What Dreams May Come. Produced by James Seymour Brett, the score was initially set to be composed by Ennio Morricone. The Italian composer had initially completed and recorded a full score for the film but, after editorial changes were made, his score was rejected and Kamen was hired in his place. Short on time, Kamen took the song \"Beside You\" from his New York Rock Ensemble\\\\\\'s album Roll Over and adapted it as the movie\\\\\\'s main musical theme. Between April 21 and 22, 1999, Kamen worked with the heavy metal band Metallica, along with The San Francisco Symphony, to record a two-day concert that was held at The Berkeley Community Theatre in Berkeley, California. The concert performance, titled S&M by Metallica, which is an acronym for \"Symphony and Metallica\", referencing the collaboration of the two artists, was released on November 23, 1999 on CD, DVD, and VHS formats, debuting at #2 on the Billboard 200, subsequently reaching multi-platinum status by 2001. Later that year, Kamen and Metallica won a Grammy Award For Best Rock Instrumental Performance for the S&M track titled \"The Call Of Ktulu\". In 2001 and 2002, Kamen performed with David Gilmour at Gilmour\\\\\\'s semi-unplugged shows at the Royal Festival Hall, playing piano and cor anglais. The 2001 concert and highlights from 2002 were released on DVD as David Gilmour in Concert. In 2002, Kamen, along with Julian Lloyd Webber, Dame Evelyn Glennie, and Sir James Galway launched the Music Education Consortium in the UK. The consortium\\\\\\'s efforts led to the injection of million for music education in the UK. He was also commissioned to write a piece for the opening ceremonies of the Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City. His last recorded work appeared on Bryan Adams\\\\\\'s album Room Service where he played the oboe and wrote the orchestration to \"I Was Only Dreamin\\\\\\'\". Kamen had also completed the charts for accompaniment to two songs on Kate Bush\\\\\\'s album Aerial, which was released in April 2005. \\n Health and death \\n Kamen was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in 1997. He died in London, England from a heart attack on November 18, 2003, at the age of 55. \\n Legacy \\n In 2004, when Annie Lennox accepted the Academy Award for Best Original Song (for \"Into the West\" from The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King), she dedicated her achievement to the memory of Kamen. The 2004 films First Daughter and Boo, Zino & the Snurks (also known as Back to Gaya), which he was working on at the time of his death, were dedicated to his memory. David Gilmour\\\\\\'s 2006 album On an Island was dedicated to the memory of Kamen and longtime Pink Floyd manager Steve O\\\\\\'Rourke.\\'b\" \\n Basilian Monastery in Vilnius \\n The Monastery of the Holy Trinity (Ukrainian: Lithuanian: Vienuolynas ir Polish: monaster is a monastery built in Vilnius by the Ruthenian Uniate Church. It belongs to the Order of Saint Basil the Great and the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church.  The church is dedicated to the Holy Trinity. Beside this church, the monastery compound contains a fortified entrance gate, a university, a hotel complex for visitors, monastic cells including the Konrad\\'s cell. The church is surrounded by adjoining four towers at each corner. This monastery is associated with the Union of Brest personalities like Josaphat Kuntsevych, Archbishop of Polatsk who took vows here and spent first years of his monastic life, as well as a prominent reformer of the Basilian Order, Veliamyn Rutsky. \\n The church \\n According to a legend, the first wooden church was built in the 14th century by Grand Princess Uliana of Tver, a spouse of the Grand Prince Algirdas. The church was built in place where in 1347 the Algirdas noblemen Antony, Johan, and Eustachy died as the first martyrs for Christian faith and the first Christian saints in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. The first stone church of Holy Trinity with a belfry was built by Konstanty Ostrogski in 1514 as a token of appreciation for a victory of Polish-Lithuanian forces over Muscovite troops near Orsha (Battle of Orsha). The original church was built in Gothic style. In first half of the 17th century to the church were added three chapels. In 1609 on an edict of the King of Poland Sigismund III Vasa the church and monastery was transferred to the Basialian Order. The first chapel Annunciation of the Holy Theotokos was built on the funds of Janusz Skumin Tyszkiewicz and was located to the right from the main entrance. In the chapel\\'s crypt were buried father of the founder, Theodor Skumin-Tyszkiewicz (d.1618), the founder himself, and his wife, Barbara Naruszewicz (d.1627). In the chapel is preserved her marble gravestone, a work of Italian masters. Nowadays in the chapel are constantly held liturgies in Byzantine rite. The second chapel that is located to the left of main entrance called St.Luke was built in 1622 on the funds of Eustachy a big supporter of the Union (Union of Brest). Beside its founder, in the crypt underneath the chapel rest his sons Ivan and Grigori. To this noble family of Korsaks belongs archimandrite the Basilian monastery of Vilnius Rafajil Mykola Korsak, later a proto-archimandrite of the Basilian Order, Metropolitan of Kiev for Eastern-rite Catholics. The third chapel is called Exaltation of the True and Life-creating Cross of our Lord. The founder of this chapel with a family crypt was a scribe of Grand Duchy of Lithuania Jan Kolenda in 1628. In the church survived valuable tombstones. Unique landmark of the Renaissance epoch in Lithuania is a tombstone of Vilna Burgomaster Othanasius Braha and his son Antony with a coat of arms, Cyrillic inscription and rich floral ornament dated 1576. Draws attention a tombstone of Jelenski sisters with sentimental inscription which comes from 1758. In 1670 significant funds to renew the church contributed Great Hetman of Lithuania Kazimierz Pac and Great Treasurer Hieronymus Kryszpin-Kirchenstein, particularly towards the altar of Saint Josaphat Kuntsevych. \\n Vilna icon of Theotokos Hodegetria \\n The fate of Vilna icon of Theotokos Hodegetria (Theotokos of Vilna) that for two centuries was located in the church of Holy Trinity is unknown. According to a legend, the icon was written by St.Luke the Evangelist and for long years it was an ancestral relic of Greek emperors in Constantinople. It is believed that a niece of the last Byzantine Emperor, Sophia Palaiologina who married the Great Prince of Muscovy Ivan III of Moscow, brought the icon to Moscow. While unconfirmed, there exists another version that the icon was transferred to the Great Prince of Moscow from prince of Halych who received it sometime ago as a present from Byzantine Emperors. Regardless of its past history, the fact states that Ivan III blessed his daughter Helena of Moscow with the icon when he gave her out in marriage for the Great Prince of Lithuania Alexander Jagiellon. The icon was brought to the capital of Grand Duchy of Lithuania and received name of Vilna. In 1866 during restoration, it was discovered that the top level is egg based tempera paint indicating very old origin of the icon. In 1915 at times of World War I during evacuation the icon was taken away from Vilnius and to this day location of Theotokos of Vilnius is unknown.\"b\" \\n Luis de Tagle, 1st Marquis of Altamira \\n Early life \\n Don Luis was born on 1642 in Santillana, Spain. He was the son of Don Anselmo de Tagle and his second wife, Juliana de la Rasa Barreda. Through his father, he was a member of the House of Tagle, one of Spain\\'s most important noble families whose origins can be traced back during the 6th century in the Kingdom of Asturias. At a very young age he left Spain and migrated to New Spain, now Mexico, amassed great power and influence. \\n Life in New Spain \\n Don Luis became the most successful and richest man in New Spain by the end of the 17th century. He had many businesses in the commercial market and held the greatest influence as the financier and buyer of the silver mines. as well as investing in large haciendas in northern Mexico. He wielded the greatest influence in the realm as well as outside it as branch members of his family also held great influence in other Spanish colonies such as Peru, Guatemala, Chile leading all the way to the Philippines (the Tagle family AND the de Tagle family whose descendants include Don Carlos Preysler de Tagle of the Banco and his daughter Isabel Preysler), where Manila was one of the greatest commercial hubs of the Spanish Empire. So great was his wealth that he was able to lend the Spanish Crown 850,000 silver pesos from 1683 to 1698. Between 1700 and 1703, Don Luis was able to lend 500,000 pesos de oro to the dynasty of Spain\\'s new king, Philip V, the first Spanish king from the House of Bourbon. In gratitude for his loyalty to the Spanish crown, King Philip V granted him the title of 1st Marquis of Altamira, reflecting his good standing in this new dynasty. The Marquis of Altamira, together with the Marquis of Santa Sabina and the Marquis of Santa Fe, composed the triumvirate which represented the Consulado of Seville and together they defended the interests of the Spanish fleet merchants in New Spain. The House of Tagle led by the Marquis of Altamira also involved itself in the Philippines. A branch of the family migrated to the colony and ensured the family\\'s influence over the country. Also, with the family ties to the colony, they managed to create a strong relationship with Fausto Cruzat, who served as the Governor General to the Philippines beginning in 1688. This relationship resulted in the engagement of Cruzat\\'s daughtern Ignacia, to Don Domingo Ruiz de Tagle, Marquis of Sierra Nevada who was the nephew of Don Luis. Don Domingo Ruiz de Tagle stayed in the Philippines starting 1708 and served as the General of the Manila-Acapulco Galleon Trade. \\n Family \\n Don Luis married Damiana de y Rojas, daughter of Don de and de Rojas. Together they had a daughter Luisa de Tagle who married her first cousin Don Pedro de Tagle. He was succeeded by his nephew and son-in-law Don Pedro de Tagle, 2nd Marquis of Altamira. The Marquis of Altamira is also the ancestor of several important aristocrats, particularly Rosa Juliana de Tagle, Marquesa of Torre Tagle and Ana Maria, Empress of Mexico was the great great great granddaughter of his brother Don Pedro de Tagle y de la Rasa, members of the House of Tagle. He is also an ancestor of Hugo O\\'Donnell, 7th Duke of Tetuan.\"b\\' \\n Samuel Snowden \\n Pastoral life \\n Prior to 1818, Reverend Snowden served as the pastor of the Chestnut Street Church in Portland, Maine. As the African-American community in the Bromfield Street Methodist Episcopal Church in Boston grew, they petitioned their bishop to establish a separate black Methodist church and to appoint Reverend Snowden as their pastor. While smaller than the prominent First African Baptist Church in Boston, they had a kind of independence. The bishop accepted their petition, and in 1818 he appointed Reverend Snowden as pastor of the newly established May Street Church.  With Reverend Snowden at the helm, the May Street Church community grew too large for their facilities, and they built a new church nearby in 1824, the Revere Street Church. Snowden served as pastor until his death in 1850. \\n Abolitionist activities \\n While pastor of the May Street and Revere Street churches, Reverend Snowden was deeply involved in the antislavery movement. David Walker, leading abolitionist and author of An Appeal to the Coloured Citizens of the World, was a member of the May Street Church. Snowden\\\\\\'s \"powerful personality and antislavery activism\" is likely what attracted Walker to his church, and the men lived across the street from each other on the north side of Beacon Hill in the late 1820s. Although his congregation supported the church as a stop on the Underground Railroad, Snowden and his family also aided fugitive slaves at their own homes. Snowden and his daughters, Isabella and Holmes, were known for welcoming fugitive slaves into their houses, offering them shelter, food, and clothing. Additionally, Reverend Snowden worked closely with William Lloyd Garrison, donating money to the cause of abolition and allowing Garrison to use his church\\\\\\'s facilities for events.\\'b\\' \\n Adolphus Buschbeck \\n Adolphus (Adolph) Buschbeck (March 23, 1822 May 28, 1883) commanded the 27th Pennsylvania Infantry in the Army of the Potomac and a brigade in that army and later in the Army of the Cumberland during the American Civil War. \\n Early life \\n Buschbeck was born in Koblenz, Germany. He migrated to the United States in 1849 and settled in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He taught mathematics at a Philadelphia high school. \\n Civil War \\n Buschbeck volunteered for service in the Civil War, becoming lieutenant colonel of the 27th Pennsylvania Infantry in September 1861. He was appointed colonel of the 27th Pennsylvania Infantry by October 2, 1861, following the resignation of Colonel Max Einstein. As colonel, Buschbeck took part in the Battle of Cross Keys under the command of Maj. Gen. John C. Buschbeck next served in 2nd Brigade, 1st Division of the I Corps of the Army of Virginia, which later became XI Corps. He became acting brigade commander at the Second Battle of Bull Run, when Julius Stahel was promoted to division command. In the Army of the Potomac, Buschbeck served under Franz Sigel and Oliver Otis Howard. At the Battle of Chancellorsville he commanded 1st Brigade, 2nd Division of the XI Corps under Adolph von Steinwehr.  Buschbeck\\\\\\'s brigade was on the left of the corps when the Confederate flanking attack hit the corps under the command of General Howard. His brigade was redeployed into the path of the Confederate advance; and Buschbeck\\\\\\'s stand against the Confederates, until flanked out of his position, earned him praise even from critics of the German troops present at Chancellorsville. Howard, in his report, even lauded Buschbeck\\\\\\'s \"praiseworthy firmness\". After Chancellorsville, Buschbeck went on leave, missing the Battle of Gettysburg. (Charles Coster commanded the brigade in his absence.) After returning to the army, he was transferred to the Western Theater, under the command of Maj. Gen. Joseph Hooker. Buschbeck\\\\\\'s brigade was present at the Battle of Wauhatchie and the Battle of Missionary Ridge, where it was engaged on the Union left under Maj. Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman in the attack on Tunnel Hill. When XI Corps was combined with XII Corps into the XX Corps under Hooker, Buschbeck was the highest ranking German officer retained in command. He led a brigade under John W. Geary (2nd Brigade, 2nd Division) in the Atlanta Campaign, in action at the Battle of Rocky Face Ridge, the Battle of Resaca, and the Battle of Dallas before being mustered out of the service. Buschbeck\\\\\\'s regiment left for Philadelphia on March 25, 1864. Nonetheless, he is listed as brigade commander April 16 to May 22, 1864. Buschbeck served with distinction but never received a promotion, even by brevet, to the rank of brigadier general. \\n Postbellum career \\n After leaving armed service, Buschbeck taught at the Episcopal Academy in Philadelphia. He married a Miss Horner in 1871, and his wife and a daughter survived him. In ill health, he left for Europe where he died, in Florence, Italy in 1883.\\'b\\' \\n Age of Glory \\n Synopsis \\n Age of Glory tells the life and love of three women in the 1960s: a dancer, a singer and a homemaker, based park break BB Park (now Sungei Wang Plaza). \\n Production \\n The production of this series cost over RM3 million for the 42 episodes.  Much emphasis is given on the aspects of 1960s nostalgia completion, including building a replica of BB Park in Port Dickson in accordance with the original plan, with elements of a unique era in fashion and these include clothes and languages spoken in the community during that period. \\n Viewership ratings \\n In the series premiere of Age of Glory, it rated about 800 thousand viewers, hence, creating a new record in Malaysian local Chinese drama series with high ratings. In addition to its high viewership ratings in Malaysia among Chinese viewers, this drama also attracted the attentions of other Chinese broadcasters, including TVB in Hong Kong, which Debbie Goh was based on.\\'b\" \\n Hill Arches 1973 \\n Hill Arches is a bronze sculpture by Henry Moore, catalogued as LH 636. The piece is made of four separate parts, three of which are described by Roger Berthoud, Moore\\'s biographer, as being stirrup-shaped; the fourth is a large sphere. One cast is situated in the Karlsplatz in front of the Karlskirche in Vienna, where it was installed in 1978 initially to complaints that it disrupted the views of the historic church. Another is sited at the headquarters of Deere and Company in Illinois.\"b\" \\n Fort Pentagouet \\n Fort  (Fort Pentagoet, Fort Castine, Fort Penobscot, Fort Saint-Pierre) was a French fort established in present-day Castine, Maine, which was the capital of Acadia It is the oldest permanent settlement in New England. Its commanding position at the mouth of the Penobscot River estuary, a lucrative source of furs and timber, as well as a major transportation route into the interior, made the peninsula of particular interest to European powers in the 17th century. Majabagaduce (as the Abenaki name would be corrupted) changed hands numerous times with shifting imperial politics. At one time or another, it was occupied by the French, Dutch and England\\'s Plymouth Colony. \\n La Tour \\n Castine was founded in the winter of 1613, when Claude de de la Tour established a small trading post to conduct business with the Tarrantine Indians (now called the Penobscots). After the trading post was established at Castine, a raid by English captain Samuel Argall at Mount Desert Island in 1613 signaled the start of a long-running dispute over the boundary between French Acadia to the north and the English colonies to the south. There is evidence that La Tour immediately challenged the English action by re-establishing his trading post in the wake of Argall\\'s raid.  Captain John Smith charted the area in 1614 and referred to French traders in the vicinity. In 1625, Charles de de la Tour erected a fort named Fort English colonists from the Plymouth Colony seized it in 1629, and made it an administrative outpost of their colony. Colonial Governor William Bradford personally traveled there to claim it. \\n Aulnay \\n From 1635 to 1654, Charles de Menou d\\'Aulnay de Charnisay defended his private commercial interests at Fort Pentagoet. In 1635, it was retaken by the French and again incorporated into Acadia; Governor Isaac de Razilly sent Charles de Menou d\\'Aulnay de Charnisay to retake the village. In 1638, Aulnay built a more substantial fort named Fort Saint-Pierre. While he had other ventures in Acadia, Fort Pentagoet was his major outpost on the frontier with New England. Emmanuel Le Borgne with 100 men raided the settlement in 1653. Major General Robert Sedgwick led 100 New England volunteers and 200 of Oliver Cromwell\\'s soldiers on an expedition against Acadia in 1654. Before taking its capital Port Royal, Sedgwick captured and plundered the French settlement at The English occupied Acadia for the next 16 years and Fort saw very little use. \\n Capital of Acadia \\n From 1670, when Acadia was returned to the French, Fort became the Capital of Acadia under two Governors Hector de Grandfontaine and Jacques de Chambly (1673-74), both formerly of the Regiment. (Saint-Castin had already set up his near-by trading post three years earlier in 1667). During the Franco-Dutch War (1674), and other Acadian ports were captured by the Dutch captain Jurriaen Aernoutsz who arrived from New Amsterdam, renaming Acadia, New Holland. The Dutch turned the fort\\'s cannon on its own walls and destroyed most of it after the second siege. Saint-Castin himself retook it in 1676 and renamed the town Bagaduce, a shortened version of Majabagaduce. \\n The Habitation of Saint-Castine \\n From 1667, after the Treaty of Breda, until 1700, Saint-Castin, former ensign at Fort Pentagoet, re-established French authority nearby at a small trading post that formed a nucleus of a new French and Indian habitation. French authorities dispatched the Baron Jean-Vincent de Saint-Castin to take command of The baron married an Abenaki woman, the daughter of the sachem Modockawando. She adopted the French name Mathilde and bore him 10 children. The baron became a widower and then married another Abenaki woman named Marie Pidiwammiskwa who bore him two additional children. Castine soon became a force in colonial trade and diplomacy. After 1677, Saint-Castin returned to his trading post within a village of 160 Etchemin Indians - two European buildings within a settlement of thirty-two wigwams. \\n King William\\'s War \\n During King William\\'s War, Castin\\'s settlement was plundered by English Governor Sir Edmund Andros in 1688. In response, Saint-Castin led an Abenaki war party to raid the English settlement at Pemaquid (present-day Bristol, Maine) in August 1689. During the Siege of Pemaquid (1689), one of the captives the Maliseet took back to their main village, Meductic, was John Gyles, who created one of the few captivity narratives to come out of Nova Scotia/Acadia. John Gyles\\' brother James was also captured by the Penobscot and eventually taken back to Fort Penobscot where he was tortured and burned alive at the stake. In 1692 the village was again seized by the English, when Major Benjamin Church destroyed the fort and looted the settlement. With the return of Baron de Saint-Castin and his sons to France, the settlement became sparsely occupied. \\n Queen Anne\\'s War \\n During Queen Anne\\'s War, in response to the French Raid on Deerfield in February 1704, New England Colonel Benjamin Church raided Castin\\'s settlement (then known as Penobscot) before moving on to raid other Acadian villages at present-day St. Stephen, New Brunswick, Grand Pisiguit (present-day Windsor, Nova Scotia), and Chignecto.  St. Castin\\'s daughter was taken in the raid.\"b\\' \\n William Lewis Wells \\n Early life \\n Wells was born in Hounslow, Middlesex, England.

Agriculture soon became the area\\'s main industry. The Beaudesert Shire Tramway had a station at Christmas Creek.  The station was once known as Lillybank and for several years was the line\\'s terminus.\"b\" \\n Sintra Air Base \\n History \\n The origins of the air base date back to the creation of the Portuguese Army\\'s School of Military Aeronautics (Portuguese: Escola de Militar, EAM) on May 14, 1914. The school was originally located at Vila Nova da Rainha and was later transferred to Granja do on February 5, 1920. In October 1939 the school was disbanded and the base was designated as Air Base No. 1. Since its creation it has been home to the main training and instruction of the Portuguese Air Force\\'s pilots and technicians, having been base to de Havilland Tiger Moth, North American T-6 Texan, Cessna T-37 Tweet, and other flight training aircraft. Between 1939 and late 1940s squadrons of ground attack and bomber units equipped with the Breda Ba-65Bis (Esquadrilha Independente de de Assalto) and converted-Junkers Ju 52/3m (Grupo de Bombardeamento de Dia and Grupo de Bombardeamento de Noite) were based at Sintra Air Base. The base later became home to the Basic Flight Training Group (Portuguese: Grupo de de Pilotagem, GIBP), with Basic Flight Training Squadron No. 1 (Portuguese: Esquadra de de Pilotagem 1, E.I.P.B. 1) and Basic Flight Training Squadron No. 2 (Portuguese: Esquadra de de Pilotagem 2, E.I.B.P. 2). From 1966, with the creation of Transport and Liaison Squadron (Portuguese: Esquadra de e Transporte), to 2009 the base was also home to transport, liaison, aerial photographic reconnaissance, and maritime patrol squadrons. In 1993, 502 Squadron was transferred to BA1. Between October 1989 and June 1993, 101 Squadron, equipped with the Epsilon TB-30, was based and operated from Sintra before being transferred to Beja Air Base. This squadron replaced both squadrons of the Basic Flight Training Group in providing elementary and basic flight training. In 2009, 101 Sqn. was transferred back to Sintra and 401 Sqn. and 502 Sqn. were transferred to Air Base No. 6 (Portuguese: Base 6, BA6). Located at the air base is also the Air Force Academy and the Air Force\\'s Air Museum.\"b\\' \\n Vyacheslav Zaitsev \\n Early life \\n Zaitsev was born on 2 March 1938 in Ivanovo to Mikhail Yakovlevich Zaitsev and Maria Ivanovna Zaitseva. His father was a victim of the repressions of Joseph Stalin and was incarcerated in one of Stalin\\\\\\'s camps, and his mother was a cleaner and laundress. From 1952 he studied Secondary School 22 in Ivanovo. As his father was deemed by the State to be an Enemy of the people, Zaitsev was denied the opportunity to study at an industrial academy, a theatrical school and a pilot training school. In 1952 he began studies in the Faculty of Applied Arts at the University of Chemistry and Technology in Ivanovo, and during this time he became interested in manufacturing and received the credentials to become a textile artist. He graduated, with honours, from the university in 1956. After realising that working with textiles was his dream, he moved to Moscow in 1956, and commenced studies at the Moscow Textile Institute, from which he graduated in 1962 with a Bachelor\\\\\\'s degree in painting and designing. Whilst he was studying at the Institute, he married Marina Vladimirovna Zaitseva in 1959, and fathered a son, Yegor Vyacheslavovich Zaitsev, in 1960. \\n Career in the Soviet Union \\n During the Soviet era, clothing was dominated by Zaitsev and Valentin Yudashkin, and he was compared to other world-renowned fashion designers such as Christian Lacroix, Christian Dior, Pierre Cardin, and Yves Saint Laurent, Zaitsev was seen as being to compete with Western designers, however, under the communist regime, the only country outside of the USSR where Zaitsev was able to work was Czechoslovakia. Alexandre Vassiliev, a Russian-born, Paris-based fashion historian and designer, stated that \"(i)f he had had a chance to show his collections abroad he would have been most possibly a world-famed brand.\" In March 1962, he began work as the artistic director of technical garment factory where he oversaw production of women\\\\\\'s clothing for retail stores in Moscow and the surrounding region. Zaitsev came to attention in 1963 when he designed a chic version of the telogreika, Pavlovsky Posad shawl-inspired skirts and multi-coloured valenki for kolkhoz workers. Whilst his creations were lauded by the authorities for \"sparkling with all colours of the rainbow\", his collection was not approved for production by the Methodical Council. In February 1963, Paris Match became the first foreign media outlet to profile Zaitsev, and highly rated his collection. In March 1965 Zaitsev became the Chief Designer at the All-Union Fashion House, which was also known as Dom Modeli, on Kuznetsky Most. In April 1965 Pierre Cardin, Marc Bohan (then with Dior) and Guy Laroche visited Moscow and became familiar with Zaitsev\\\\\\'s works, although Zaitsev wasn\\\\\\'t present, and was covered in an article of Paris Match. Pierre Cardin called Zaitsev an \"equal among equals\", and the French press dubbed him the Red Dior Between 1968 Zaitsev\\\\\\'s works, dubbed the Russian series, were displayed abroad. He resigned from the All-Union Fashion House in 1978, and began to work out of a small studio. His mother, with whom he had a great affinity died in the same year, and after her death he took up the writing of poetry. Zaitsev designed a collection of costumes for the Soviet team for the 1980 Summer Olympics which were held in Moscow, for which he was awarded the Order of the Badge of Honor. He authored two books in 1980, \"Such Changeable Fashion\" (Russian: and \"This Multifaceted World of Fashion\" (Russian: which were republished in Bulgaria and Czechoslovakia in 1983. In 1982 he transformed his studio into the Moscow Fashion House (Russian: also known as Dom Modi, becoming the first Soviet couturier who was permitted by the Soviet Government to label his own clothing. By the mid-1980s, Dom Modi employed 600 civil servants and was required to produce some 2 million rubles worth of clothing each year. In 1984 it was reported that Dom Modi had served 10,000 customers, and prices ranged from US$170 to US$260 for dresses, and up to US$1000 for haute couture gowns. Zaitsev met with Thierry Mugler in 1985 in Moscow, and the French couturier photographed Zaitsev\\\\\\'s fashions for an article in Paris Match. Raisa Gorbachyova wore Zaitsev creations when she made what The New York Times described as a \"perestroika splash\" in the 1980s. Due to the patronage of the Soviet First Lady, he gained a reputation as one of the world\\\\\\'s hottest fashion designers, and became an international celebrity in his own right and a household name in Russia. Zaitsev fashions were displayed at Expo \\\\\\'85 in Tsukuba, Japan, although it wasn\\\\\\'t until 1986 when he was able to visit a capitalist country when he displayed some of his works in the Soviet pavilion at Expo 86 in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. A member of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, Zaitsev affirmed his belief in the Soviet Union and the future of communism, including the communist ideals of a workers\\\\\\' paradise. The New York Times reported that by the 1980s, he became disillusioned with the Party. Zaitsev told the newspaper that at mandatory party meetings he \"began to defend the right to be free, as it says in the Communist charter. They constantly tried to distract me, not to let me get in. I\\\\\\'d be stuck in the elevator or I\\\\\\'d be sent off to some other event.\" This disillusionment led to Zaitsev quitting the party in the late 1980s. Zaitsev often complained to the Soviet authorities about the lack of essential materials for his craft, which The New York Times noted in 1988 that he \"until recently\" was forced to use dressmaker\\\\\\'s mannequins from World War II. Zaitsev signed a three-year contract with Intertorg Inc. in August 1987, which saw Dom Modi selling its designs in the United States, with profits going to the design house rather than the Soviet Treasury. The contract was the first commercial consumer venture signed between the two countries. In October 1987 he showed his collection at the iconic Waldorf-Astoria in New York City, which critics called overwrought, out-of-date and reminiscent of Western fashion from several seasons earlier. Undiscouraged, Zaitsev said that he planned to return with a \"pared-down, sexier collection\". He returned to New York City in 1988 where he designed costumes for the musical revue Sophisticated Ladies, based on the music of Duke Ellington. Participation in his first Paris fashion shows came in January 1988 at the invitation of Madame Carven, whom Zaitsev met in Moscow in December 1987, showing his collection under the banner of \"Russian Seasons\". He also joined the Maison de Couture and was made an honorary citizen of Paris, by then Mayor Jacques Chirac. The following year in March, Maison de Couture named Zaitsev as \"Man of the Year in the World of Fashion\" In September 1989, Zaitsev showed his collections in West Germany for the first time under the theme \"Fashion and Music Revue \\\\\\'90\", and in December 1989 he won first prize at \"Five top fashion designers in the world-90\" in Tokyo, Japan, where he was competing against Donna Karan, Claude Montana, Hanae Mori and Byblos. \\n Career in Russia \\n Whilst during the Soviet era Zaitsev\\\\\\'s work was funded by the Soviet government, which as a state employee he earned the maximum of 1,000 rubles per month, after the collapse of the Soviet Union he became responsible for financing the business out of his private income, with New Russians making up the bulk of his clientele. In 1991 he designed a new uniform for the Russian police, and was bestowed the title of Honored Worker in the Field of the Arts. By 1992, Jane Fonda, Ted Turner and Herb Ritts were amongst celebrities who became customers of Zaitsev, and in the same year Zaitsev launched a women\\\\\\'s perfume named Maroussia, in conjunction with French-based The perfume which is classified as a floral oriental and is still in production, was launched in a few European countries in 1992 and was launched worldwide in 1993. 1992 was also a significant year in Zaitsev\\\\\\'s career, because it was then that he presented for the first time his recent fashion collection, as well as his paintings and works on paper in prestigious venues, both in New York and in Beverly Hills. Never before was Russian fashion design demonstrated on the American runways, and never before were Zaitsev\\\\\\'s most personal paintings and drawings allowed to be exhibited in the West. Fashion shows and exhibitions were held at the Bowles-Sorokko Galleries on both the East and the West Coasts, and they were widely attended, marking the beginning of cultural exchanges in the area of visual arts between the USA and the new Russia. According to Serge Sorokko, then president of the Bowles-Sorokko Galleries, Mr. Zaitsev was a lifelong painter, but was never free to exhibit publicly his art before. \"[That was] because his work was outside the dogmas of socialist realism,\" Mr. Sorokko told The New York Times. \"He was permitted to paint only for his own soul. When I visited his home in Moscow, I saw 20 years of pictorial work on his walls.\" In 1994, Zaitsev hosted the inaugural Nadezhda Lamanova Prize competition for professional Russian designers at Dom Modi, and the competition has been held under his patronage since. In 1996 he launched a competition in Russia, using the slogan of \"Goodbye Barbie, welcome Maroussia\", to find the \"purest essence of\" female adolescence, with the aim of decreasing the influence of the American doll in Russia. In Zaitsev\\\\\\'s words, \"Barbie is rigid, cold, cynical, pragmatic. Now look at the faces of our children... they are not only beautiful, but sweet, charming and mysterious. In every face there\\\\\\'s a secret, and so must the new Russian doll\". Also in 1996, a follow-up to 1992s Maroussia, a floriental fragrance named Authentic Maroussia was launched but has since been discontinued. Zaitsev was the tailor to Vladimir Zhirinovsky for his 1996 Russian presidential campaign. Zaitsev, who planned to vote for Boris Yeltsin, stated on Zhirinovsky, \"He wanted something distinctly Russian, so I thought back to the military-style jackets of the 20s, the Stalin, only in new colours\". On 27 May 1996, President of Russia Boris Yeltsin awarded Zaitsev the State Prize of the Russian Federation in the field of literature and the arts. In 1996, Zaitsev was also made an honorary citizen of the city of his birth, Ivanovo. His 2001 collection entitled Dedication saw the most expensive dresses costing between 12,000, whilst the cheapest were in the 3,000 price range. When then-President of Russia Vladimir Putin was due to travel on a state visit to the United Kingdom in June 2003, Zaitsev designed attire for First Lady of Russia Lyudmila Putina to wear for the visit, which included an audience with Queen Elizabeth II. Zaitsev told Zhizn that it took some time to convince Putina to wear a hat, due to Russian women in general not wearing them. By February 2005, Zaitsev had opened 4 stores in Ryazan, Ufa, Orenburg and Samara. The New York Times described Zaitsev in 2004 as one of the few Soviet icons who is still an icon in modern-day Russia, and Time Magazine reported in 2007 that the Zaitsev name has 93% brand awareness in Russia. In 2007 Kommersant commissioned VCIOM to run a poll on public perception as to the make-up of the Russian elite; Zaitsev, who is often referred to as the Patriarch of Russian fashion, was rated at 74. Zaitsev is not interested in achieving worldwide renown by showing his creations abroad, preferring to stay true to his Russian roots and encourages other Russian designers not to be influenced by the West. Zaitsev was quoted by Women\\\\\\'s Wear Daily in April 2008 as saying: \"I think that as a Russian artist, I should show in Russia. At the beginning of the 1990s, I had the chance to show in Paris, and I realised that it\\\\\\'s not my place.\" In 2007 Zaitsev took part in the TV show \"Fashion Sentence\" (Russian: on Channel One, in which he acted as a judge passing down sentence on contestant\\\\\\'s fashion sense. After visiting Ashgabat in June 2008 for the Turkmen Textile Exhibition, Zaitsev stated that he was fascinated by traditional Turkmen clothing, and announced plans for a new collection which would incorporate traditional Turkmen elements. The casual wear collection is to be made exclusively from cotton from Turkmenistan and would feature the traditional Turkmen embroidery which captured his imagination. In September 2008, Zaitsev participated in \"The Russian Evening-2008\" at the Institute for International Political Studies in Milan, which was attended by Svetlana Medvedeva and Clio Maria Bittoni, the wife of Italian President Giorgio Napolitano. Zaitsev has always been an admirer of the costumes sketches supplied by Pablo Picasso and Albert Benois, amongst others, for Sergei Diaghilev\\\\\\'s Paris troupe, and to celebrate the 100th anniversary of Diaghilev\\\\\\'s Ballets Russes, Zaitsev\\\\\\'s collection for the 2009 Russian Fashion Week pays homage to the Russian ballet impresario. The Eremitage in Sankt Petersburg honors since June 2016 Zaitsev\\\\\\'s work with an extensive exhibition of his work. The new exhibition will be a big step toward creating a costume museum at the world-famous Eremitage. The exposition unveils many of the creations of the Slava Zaitsev Fashion House in Moscow over the past 30 years, along with clothing design sketches and the  photos. \\n Style \\n Zaitsev stated that his mother, Maria Ivanovna, was a cleaning lady and never owned a fancy dress. In 2004, the New York Times stated, \"(i)t is her stolid image that he has been dressing all these years in flounces and feathers, poufs and peplums, gold and glitter.\" During the Soviet era, he regularly complained that he designed collections for the \"larger\" woman in the 1970s, but only models up to size 48 were accepted for production. Whilst Zaitsev regards fashion designers Coco Chanel, Christian Dior, Gianfranco and Hubert de Givenchy as idols, his own creations are strongly influenced by traditional Russian and Slavic styles, and his collections include a variety of theme-based shows reflecting his take on the industry at the time. Past collections include the Millennium of the Christianisation of Russia in 1988; Russian Seasons in Paris in 1988; Agony of Perestroika in 1991; and Recollections of the Future in 1997. In his creations, Zaitsev includes elements such as traditional Pavlovsky Posad shawls and embroidered quilted jackets, which have been featured in collections such as Expectation of Changes. \\n Dom Modi \\n As of 2009, Dom Modi employs 500 people.\\'b\\' \\n Haka (sports) \\n The haka, a traditional dance of the people, has been used in sports in New Zealand and overseas. The challenge has been adopted by the New Zealand national rugby union team, the \"All Blacks\", and a number of other New Zealand national teams perform before their international matches; some non-New Zealand sports teams have also adopted the haka. \\n History \\n During the New Zealand Native team toured the Home Nations of the United Kingdom, the first team from a colony to do so. It was originally intended that only players would be selected, but four were finally included. As the were born in New Zealand, the name \"Native\" was considered justified. The team performed a haka before the start of their first match on 3 October 1888 against Surrey. They were described as using the words \"Ake ake kia kaha\" which suggests that the haka was not \"Ka Mate\". It was intended that before each match they would perform the haka dressed in traditional costume but the costumes were soon discarded. The \"Ka Mate\" haka was not well known at this time. In 1900, a newspaper reported New Zealand soldiers in the Boer War chanting \"Ka Mate! Ka Mate! Ka ora! Ka ora! Hae-haea! Ha!\" The soldiers thought it meant \"Kill him! Chop him up! Baste him!\" But during the 1901 Royal Tour, Ngati Kahungunu warriors revived \"Ka Mate\" when they performed it to welcome the Duke of Cornwall at Rotorua. Newspapers described the full actions of this \"ancient ngeri\", printing its complete Maori words and an accurate translation. A movie cameraman recorded the performance. \"Ka Mate\" became famous, and was widely performed throughout New Zealand. Nevertheless, when New Zealand played its first full international test match against Australia in Sydney in August 1903, the New Zealanders\\\\\\' war cry was \"Tena Koe Kangaroo.\" (full details below) In 1905 New Zealand made their first tour of Britain. This was the first time the team were referred to as the All Blacks and this particular team also became known as the \\\\\\'Originals\\\\\\'. It is uncertain whether they performed a haka before every match, but they at least performed \"Ka Mate\" before their first test, against Scotland, and before the match against Wales. The Welsh crowd, led by the Welsh team, responded by singing the Welsh national anthem. When a New Zealand Army team played Wales in 1916, the words of \"Ka Mate\" were included in the printed programme, indicating that the haka was established as an accompaniment to New Zealand rugby teams playing overseas. The New Zealand rugby team which toured the United Kingdom, Irish Free State, France and Canada and which was nicknamed the Invincibles, performed a haka that was written for them during the voyage to England by two supporters, Judge Frank Acheson of the Native Land Court and Wiremu Rangi of Gisborne. The haka was led by star player George Nepia. It was performed before all but two of the tour matches. Reporters criticised the team for disappointing the crowd on the two occasions it was not performed. A pre-match haka was not always performed on All Blacks tours. The team that toured Britain in did not perform one before matches, although they did some impromptu performances at social functions. In the early decades, haka were only rarely performed at home matches, such as the third test of the 1921 Springboks tour, played in Wellington. \\n \"Ka Mate\" \\n The All Blacks are believed to have first performed a choreographed and synchronized version of the \"Ka Mate\" haka in 1905. It is said that this Haka was composed by Te Rauparaha of Toa to commemorate his escape from death during an incident in 1810. Chased by his enemies, he hid in a food-storage pit under the skirt of a woman. He climbed out to find someone standing over him, who, instead of killing Te Rauparaha, turned out to be another chief friendly to him. In relief, Te Rauparaha performed this ancient haka, which had been performed all through Aotearoa for centuries. The story of Te Rauparaha was merely woven into several older stories about this haka. \\n \"Ko Niu Tireni\" 1924 \\n The Invincibles performed this haka during their unbeaten tour. It was written during their voyage to England by Wiremu Rangi of Gisborne, and polished up by Judge Acheson of the Native Land Court. It had two verses, but the second verse (Put a few of your famous teams on display, and let\\\\\\'s play each other in friendship) was omitted in later matches. \\n The haka in \"Finnegans Wake\" \\n Irish writer James Joyce heard this haka performed at the Invincibles\\\\\\' match at Paris in January 1925. He modified some of the words and used them in his word-play novel Finnegans Wake. Let us propel us for the frey of the fray! Us, us, beraddy! Ko Niutirenis hauru leish! A lala! Ko Niutirenis haururu laleish! Ala lala! The Wullingthund sturm is breaking. The sound of maormaoring The Wellingthund sturm waxes fuercilier.    Finnegans Wake, 2nd ed. 1950, Book II chap iii, page 335. \\n Overview \\n Before a Tri Nations match against South Africa on 27 August 2005 at Carisbrook in Dunedin, the All Blacks unexpectedly introduced a new haka, \"Kapa o Pango\". It featured an extended and aggressive introduction by team captain Tana Umaga highlighted by a drawing of the thumb down the throat. This was interpreted by many as a \"throat-slitting\" action directed at the opposing team. The All Blacks went on to win the match 31 to 27. The words to \"Kapa o Pango\" are more specific to the rugby team than \"Ka Mate\", referring to the warriors in black and the silver fern.  The new haka was developed by Derek Lardelli of Porou by modifying the first verse of \"Ko Niu Tirini,\" the haka used by the 1924 All Blacks. An NZRU press release stated that Kapa o Pango has been over a year in the making, and was created in consultation with many experts in culture. It will serve as a complement to \"Ka Mate\" rather than a replacement, to be used for \\\\\\'special occasions\\\\\\'. \\n Responses and controversies \\n The haka, while normally enjoyed by spectators, has been criticised as an unsporting attempt to intimidate the opposition before the match begins.  However, most teams accept that the haka is part of rugby\\\\\\'s heritage and face up to the All Blacks during its performance, with both teams standing about 10 metres apart. The 2007 Portuguese Rugby team Captain Vasco Uva said of the haka that \"[We] faced it, gave it the respect it deserved and it gave us motivation and we knew if it gave them strength, it was also a point of strength for us.\" Ignoring the haka is a tactic sometimes used by opposing teams. Famously, the Australian rugby team did a warm up drill well away from the All Blacks during their 1996 test match in Wellington. More recently, the Italian rugby team ignored the haka during a 2007 World Cup Pool Match. All Black team member, Keven Mealamu, said later that in his opinion the snub had backfired and provided motivation to his team. Australian back David Campese often ignored the haka, most notably in the 1991 World Cup semi-final victory over the All Blacks, when he chose to practice warm-up drills instead of facing the All Blacks. In 1989, as the All Blacks were performing the haka in Lansdowne Road before playing Ireland, the Irish lined up in a tight V formation to facing New Zealand and then edged closer and closer to the All Blacks. By the time the end of the haka came, captain Willie Anderson was only inches from Buck Shelford\\\\\\'s face. In 1997, Richard Cockerill was disciplined for responding to the haka before the start of an England vs. All Blacks game. Cockerill went toe-to-toe with his opposite number Norm Hewitt while they performed the haka. The referee became so concerned that Hewitt and Cockerill would begin fighting that he pushed Cockerill away from Hewitt. Cockerill went on to say afterwards \"I believe that I did the right thing that day,\" he said. \"They were throwing down a challenge and I showed them I was ready to accept it. I\\\\\\'m sure they would rather we did that than walk away.\" In recent times when the haka is performed against England, it is often drowned out by England fans singing \"Swing Low, Sweet Chariot\". In 2005, the All Blacks agreed to a request from the Welsh Rugby Union to repeat the sequence of events from the original match a century before in 1905. This involved the All Blacks performing the haka after \"God Defend New Zealand\" and before \"Hen Wlad fy Nhadau\". For the November 2006 test, the Welsh Rugby Union demanded a repeat of this sequence. The All Blacks refused, and instead chose to perform the haka in their changing room before the match. All Blacks captain Richie McCaw defended the decision by stating that the haka was \"integral to New Zealand culture and the All Blacks\\\\\\' heritage\" and \"if the other team wants to mess around, we\\\\\\'ll just do the haka in the shed\". The crowd reacted negatively to the lack of the haka and then being shown brief footage of the haka on the screens at the Millennium Stadium. In 2006, the Seven Network TV channel in Australia aired a commercial which used digital enhancement to add handbags to video of New Zealand rugby players performing the haka. This was inspired by an incident when former All Black captain Tana Umaga struck Hurricanes teammate Chris Masoe over the head with a woman\\\\\\'s handbag after the Super 14 final. All Blacks assistant coach Wayne Smith criticised the advertisement, saying \"It is insensitive, I think, to and disrespectful of the All Blacks\". The \"Kapa o Pango\" haka created controversy when the gesture of a thumb drawn down the throat was interpreted by many observers as implying throat slitting. The All Blacks and interpreted it as drawing the breath of life into the heart and lungs (\"hauora\"). This led to calls for it to be banned, although a poll conducted in July 2006 showed 60 percent support in New Zealand. During Ireland\\\\\\'s tour of New Zealand, the NZRU put the haka on a temporary hiatus, to review its appropriateness, by asking the All Blacks not to perform it against Ireland. In the 2007 Rugby World Cup quarter-finals, France, after having won the coin toss for the choice of uniforms, famously wore the blue/white/red of the French flag and walked up to within a metre of the haka performance, forming a line of opposition to the performance by the All Blacks, who were wearing a predominantly silver uniform (as opposed to the traditional all black). France went on to beat the All Blacks In the 2008 Rugby Autumn Tests, Wales responded to the haka by standing on the pitch refusing to move until the All Blacks did. This resulted in the referee Jonathan Kaplan berating both teams for a full two minutes after the haka had ended until eventually New Zealand captain McCaw instructed his team to break off. After a spirited first half display which ended with Wales leading the All Blacks responded positively and won the game Following the final of the 2011 World Cup, the French national team was fined by the IRB for marching to within 10 metres of their All Black opponents during the performance of the haka. To many, this has been viewed as an insult from the IRB. \\n Use by other teams \\n Other New Zealand sports teams have similarly performed the haka before a match. The tradition of performing a haka before every test match is just as strong with the Kiwis, the New Zealand national rugby league team, performing it before every game. Traditionally they performed the \"Ka Mate\" haka, but starting at the 2013 Rugby League World Cup they perform a team-specific haka called \"Te Iwi Kiwi\". It is also performed by the Australian rules football team and Tall Blacks. The New Zealand have performed the \\\\\\'Timatanga\\\\\\' haka since 2001. In the documentary Murderball, the New Zealand paralympic rugby team can be seen performing a modified version of the haka. When Munster hosted the All Blacks at Thomond Park, Limerick in November 2008, the four New Zealand players in the Munster team performed their own haka prior to the All Blacks. At the opening parade of the 2002 Commonwealth Games in Manchester, the New Zealand team stopped in front of the Queen and performed a haka. New Zealand teams have attracted some criticism for performing the haka, on occasions such as winning a swim relay bronze medal. In 2009, Ice Blacks did their haka before their ice hockey match against Australia. The Tall Blacks performed the dance prior to its games in the 2014 FIBA tournament, including a contest against the United States, where video of the dance was widely circulated and sparked discussion. The Black Sticks, the (field) hockey team, also perform a haka. The high-profile of the All Blacks, and their use of the haka has led other Pacific teams to use similar dances from their own cultures, such as the Cibi, Kailao, and Siva tau. Other teams from the Pacific and elsewhere however have performed the \"Ka Mate\" or \"Kapa o Pango\" haka. For instance, the \"Kapa o Pango\" haka was used by the University of Hawaii Warriors in 2006, before they created their own war dance, the in the Hawaiian language with original movements.\\'b\\' \\n District \\n Geography \\n District borders with District to the northeast, District (Pest County) and District County) to the east, Paks District (Tolna County) to the south, District, District and District to the west.

He had a sister, Ilna. He joined the Army and was posted to Fort H. G. Wright, and then to the area prep school at Fort Preble, Maine. He was accepted into the United States Military Academy at West Point, which he entered on 1 July 1937. The West Point Yearbook noted that he \"came to West Point from the Army with a determination to do his best in whatever he attempted. We can see from his record that his best was exceptional.\" Moody was ranked first in his class, which graduated and was commissioned as second lieutenants on 1 July 1941. Traditionally, the highest ranked graduates in the class joined the United States Army Corps of Engineers, but Moody chose to join the cavalry instead. He married Jean Enwright, whom he had known since childhood. They had four daughters, all with names starting with the letter J: Judith, Jean, Joan, and Joy. \\n World War II \\n On 1 August 1941, he assumed command of a platoon in Troop F, 14th Cavalry at Fort Riley, Kansas. He attended the United States Army Cavalry School from 3 October to 23 December 1941, shortly after the United States entered World War II, and was a platoon commander in Troop E, 6th Cavalry from 20 January to 15 May 1942. He returned to West Point as an instructor in Chemical and Electrical Engineering, where he was promoted to first lieutenant on 15 June 1942, captain on 15 December 1942, and major on 4 January 1944. In May 1944, Moody was posted to the European Theater of Operations, where he served on the staff of SHAEF until 14 September 1944. He then returned to the United States, where he saw duty in Washington, D.C., with the Operations Division (OPD) of the War Department General Staff and in the China-Burma-India Theater. After attending the Command and General Staff School at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, from 8 January to 6 March 1945, he was posted to the Cavalry Replacement Training Center at Fort Riley, and then, on 9 July 1945, to the staff of the Central Pacific Base Command on Okinawa. On 15 August 1945, he became Assistant Chief of Staff (G-3) of the 7th Infantry Division, then also based on Okinawa, but which subsequently participated in the United States occupation of Korea after the war ended. He was promoted to lieutenant colonel on 15 March 1946, and was awarded the Bronze Star Medal for his services. \\n Later life \\n Moody\\\\\\'s appointment as a lieutenant colonel in the Army of the United States was terminated on 31 May 1946, and he reverted to his substantive rank of first lieutenant in the cavalry. He became an instructor at Fort Knox, Kentucky, on 14 June 1947, and became a captain again on 1 July 1948. He attended Yale University, where he earned a Master of Arts degree in international relations in 1950. He was then posted back to The Pentagon for duty in the Office of the Chief of Staff of the Army. This was followed by a posting to the headquarters of the United States European Command in Paris, and then a tour as a tank battalion commander in Germany. In due course he returned to Fort Carson, Colorado. After graduating from the United States Army War College, he returned to the Office of the Chief of Staff of the Army, and then was posted to Korea, where he commanded a brigade. The tour of command in Korea was cut short, and Moody returned to the United States for duty as the Military Assistant to Robert McNamara, the Secretary of Defense. He was promoted to brigadier general in July 1966. After learning how to fly helicopters at Fort Rucker, Alabama, he was appointed the Assistant Division Commander of the 1st Cavalry Division, then engaged in combat in Vietnam during the Vietnam War in March 1967. Moody took up his new posting at the Camp Radcliff, in An Khe, Vietnam, but on 19 March 1967, just a week after he arrived, he said he was not feeling well, and asked for a doctor to be sent to his quarters. He died of a heart attack shortly after the doctor arrived. He was survived by his father, and his wife and four daughters. His body was returned to the United States, and he was buried in Arlington National Cemetery on 24 March 1967 with full military honors. His name was subsequently inscribed on the wall of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington, DC. His decorations included the Distinguished Service Medal, the Legion of Merit with two oak leaf clusters, the Bronze Star Medal, the Air Medal with six oak leaf clusters, Army Commendation Medal, and the Purple Heart.\\'b\" \\n Dhuwala \\n The Dhuwala (Duala, Du:ala) are an indigenous Australian people of eastern Arnhem Land in the Northern Territory. \\n Country \\n Norman Tindale stated that the Dhuwala\\'s lands were basically coextensive with those assigned to the Dhuwal, the two peoples inhabiting the same territory but being distinguished by linguistic differences, moiety type, and clan estate localities.

Gregory made his professional football debut in 1972, at the age of 18, when playing for Northampton Town. He scored eight goals in 187 games over the next five years, before being transferred to First Division Aston Villa in 1977. Gregory was a considerable success at Aston Villa. Despite playing two divisions higher than he had ever done before, he adapted well to First Division football and scored 10 goals in 65 games over the next two seasons. During his time at Villa, Gregory became the only player to play in every outfield position, wearing every number from 2 to 11 over his two seasons with the club, which remains a record. In 1979, Gregory signed for Brighton & Hove Albion, who had just won promotion to the First Division for the first time in their history. He scored seven goals in 72 games over the next two seasons before dropping down into the Second Division to sign for Queen\\'s Park Rangers. He was part of the QPR side that reached the FA Cup final in 1982 (losing to Tottenham Hotspur in a replay) and won promotion to the First Division a year later as Second Division champions. He also helped QPR finish fifth and qualify for the UEFA Cup in 1984, but was a tough season for Gregory and his colleagues after manager Terry Venables departed to Barcelona and successor Frank Sibley was unable to keep up QPR\\'s good form. At the end of a difficult season in which QPR only narrowly stayed in the First Division, Gregory dropped down two divisions to sign for fallen giants Derby County. Derby County, champions of England in 1972 and 1975, had fallen into the Third Division in 1984 and had failed to win promotion in Gregory was the centerpiece of their midfield as they achieved promotion to the Second Division at the end of the season and to the First Division (as Second Division champions) a year later. Gregory stayed for one season as Derby County survived their first top flight season for nearly a decade, before announcing his retirement as a player. He played a total of 93 league appearances for the Rams, scoring 22 goals. When taking over as manager of Plymouth Argyle early in 1990, Gregory re-registered himself as a player and appeared three times for them in the Second Division. On departing from the Home Park club, he moved 300 miles north to play for Third Division Bolton Wanderers, making seven appearances before finally retiring as a player at the age of 36. \\n Managerial career \\n His first two spells in management (between January 1989 and June 1990), first with Portsmouth and then with Plymouth Argyle, lasted just a few months each. Shortly afterwards, he linked up as a non-contract player with his former England and Northampton Town teammate Phil Neal, who was then manager at Bolton Wanderers. He later worked under Brian Little on the coaching staff at Leicester City and Aston Villa before moving back into management with Wycombe Wanderers in September 1996. Wycombe were bottom of Division Two when Gregory took over, but he oversaw a massive improvement in league form which saw the club climb up to a secure mid-table finish. However, the side he put together failed to progress any further, and they also suffered an embarrassing FA Cup exit to Basingstoke Town. Wycombe were performing well in February 1998 when Gregory quit to take the manager\\'s job back at Aston Villa. He helped improve Villa\\'s league form during the final 3 months of the season and they qualified for the UEFA Cup. Halfway through the season, Villa were Premiership leaders but a slump in form saw the club eventually finish sixth in the final table and miss out on a first Premiership title. Villa reached the FA Cup final in 2000 but lost to Chelsea. Gregory quit in January 2002, with Villa going on to finish eighth that season. Gregory\\'s next spell in management was with Derby County (January 2002 March 2003). When he took charge at Derby they were bottom of the Premiership, but after winning both of his first two games at the helm it looked as though he might be able to save them from relegation. Unfortunately, seven defeats from their final eight fixtures saw Derby slip out of the Premiership after six years. The club\\'s financial problems meant that Gregory hadn\\'t purchased any players during the season, and their subsequent form in Division One was disappointing. He was sacked in March 2003 for alleged misconduct but later won in compensation for unfair dismissal. Due to the ongoing lawsuit, Gregory was unable to apply for another managerial position for some time, so he spent most of the next three years working as a television pundit. On 20 September 2006 he was unveiled as manager of Queens Park Rangers. He replaced Gary Waddock, who had stepped down following a poor succession of results that had left the club bottom of the Football League Championship. This appointment caused a schism among QPR fans, some of whom saw Gregory\\'s friendship with controversial chairman Gianni Paladini as a conflict of interest. After a decent start with successive victories over Hull City and Southampton, Rangers form dipped before winning three on the bounce (including a victory at (then) league leaders Cardiff City). Unfortunately, results did not continue to improve, and relegation looked a distinct possibility for Gregory\\'s men. However, following a fine late season run, QPR beat Cardiff at Loftus Road on 21 April 2007 to secure their Championship status for another year. Gregory was sacked as QPR manager on 1 October 2007, after another string of poor performances. On 8 December 2009, Gregory was appointed the manager of Israeli club Maccabi Ahi Nazareth. He led them to relegation. On 18 May 2010, Gregory signed a 3-year contract with Israeli Premier League Club F.C. Ashdod. He resigned from Ashdod on 18 April 2011, with the club facing the possibility of relegation. On 13 June 2011, Gregory was appointed the manager of Kazakh club FC Kairat from Almaty, Kazakhstan. Kairat survived relegation at the end of the 2011 season to the second tier of Kazakhstan football. Gregory had his contract as manager of FC Kairat terminated in December 2011, and in April 2012 was paid $120,000 in compensation. On 3 December 2013, Gregory was named as the manager of Crawley Town, replacing previous manager Richie Barker. On 27 December 2014, after being Crawley Town manager for just over a year Gregory stepped down as manager due to health problems; on the same day Crawley Town named former Welsh international and former Wolverhampton Wanderers manager Dean Saunders as interim manager. \\n Chennaiyin \\n On 3 July 2017, Gregory signed as head coach of Chennaiyin in the Indian Super League.  On 17 March 2018, he led to Chennaiyin to their second Indian Super League title by defeating Bengaluru in the finals. On 19 March 2018, Gregory extended his contract for one year.\"b\\' \\n ARP 16-Voice Electronic Piano \\n Pedal assembly \\n The unit featured two brass pedals, right for sustain, left soft pedal or vibrato.\\'b\\' \\n Orders, decorations, and medals of Slovakia \\n The  Slovak Republic has a system of orders and decorations for citizens who do great deeds for the country. With the exception of the Order of the White Double Cross, all the orders of Slovakia are reserved for Slovak citizens. Slovak decorations and medals are rarely bestowed. In 2015 less than nine awards were granted. \\n Andrej Hlinka Order \\n Andrej Hlinka Order is conferred upon Slovak citizens \"for Special Merit for the establishment of the Slovak Republic.\" The Order is symbolized by a medallion with a central white cross on the center of the cross there is the Andrej Hlinka\\\\\\'s profile. The ribbon of the order is blue with a central stripe. Andrej Hlinka Order is broken into three different classes: 1st class, 2nd class and 3rd class. \\n Pribina Cross \\n Pribina Cross is awarded to Slovak citizens for \"special merit for economic, social or cultural development of the Slovak Republic\". The badge of this Order represents the Pribina\\\\\\' head on a red background; the ribbon of the order is dark red with a central crown. Pribina Cross is broken into three different classes: 1st class, 2nd class and 3rd class. \\n Milan Rastislav Cross \\n The Milan Rastislav Cross is awarded to Slovak citizens \"for risking own life to defend Slovakia, for risking own life to save other life, or for risking own life to save material values.\" The badge of this Order represents the Milan Rastislav head on a pale blue background; the ribbon of the order is pale blue.

Having taken a proper military education, he was later promoted to general of the Russian army. \\n Career \\n Wounded in the Russo-Japanese war he was visited at a hospital by the Tsar Nicholas II, who awarded him St Cross and invited the general to the palace. He fought also on the battlefields of World War I, but returned to Georgia after the February Revolution in 1917. He formed two national divisions and secured the capital Tbilisi from the chaotically retreating and increasingly Bolshevist Russian soldiers. In April 1918, he successfully defended the southwestern province Guria from the Ottoman offensive winning a victory on the Choloki River. In June 1918, he served as a governor general of Abkhazia and crushed there a pro-Bolshevik revolt; then he took Gagra, Sochi and Tuapse in the first phase of the Sochi conflict. From October to December 1918, he served as a governor general of Tbilisi. During the December Georgian-Armenian war 1918, he was appointed a commander-in-chief and successfully defended the Georgian borders from the troops of General Dro. In 1919 he served as a governor general of Akhaltsikhe and Akhalkalaki and was moved, on 6 October 1920, as a commandant in Tbilisi. During the Soviet invasion of February 1921, he repulsed the Red Army from the Soghanlughi heights at the outskirts of Tbilisi. The war, however, was lost. Mazniashvili did not follow the leaders in exile, but mobilized the remnants of the Georgian armed forces to recover the Black Sea city of Batumi from the Turkish occupation, March 1921. The newly established Soviet government of Georgia declared him outlaw, but later offered him a nominal post in the Red Army. \\n Later life and death \\n In 1923, during the Red Terror, he was arrested and exiled to Persia whence he moved to France. In a few years, he was allowed to return and he lived in his native village Sasireti, far from political life. During the Great Purges, however, he was arrested and executed without a trial in 1937. In the 1950s, Mazniashvili\\'s son, a World War II veteran of the Soviet army, submitted a request for a political rehabilitation of his father, but this was turned down by the authorities. \\n Legacy \\n Maznashvili is the author of the popular Memoirs. In 2013, he was posthumously awarded the title and Order of National Hero of Georgia.\"b\\' \\n Athach \\n Publication history \\n The athach first appeared in the Dungeons & Dragons Master Rules set (1985). The creature also appeared in the Dungeons & Dragons Rules Cyclopedia (1991). The athach appeared in the second edition Advanced Dungeons & Dragons under the \"giant\" entry in the Mystara Monstrous Compendium Appendix (1994). The athach appeared in the third edition Monster Manual (2000), and then the 3.5 Monster Manual. The athach appeared as a player character race and class in Savage Species (2003). \\n Description \\n An athach resembles something akin to an ogre, a troll, a fomorian or other such highly ugly giant, only with three arms. Two arms are located in the places where normal humanoids have their arms, while the third one sprouts from the chest. Athachs have sickly green coloration, and are covered in a layer of short, soft, brown fur. They have pear-shaped, flabby bodies, orc-like faces, black teeth, many warts and veins in their skin, and curly (if matted) hair and beards. Apparently, they are also poisonous. \\n Habits and characteristics \\n Athachs can be either solitary, or in gangs of up to 2 or 4 individuals or tribes of 7 to 12. They are depicted as wearing the hides of dead farm animals, and sometimes tribal decorations of bones, jewelry and webs of rope. Not overly intelligent, they prefer to attack by charging, with a morning star in each of their three hands, into enemies and flailing at them indiscriminately (after a few rounds, however, they will typically attack whoever is causing them the most damage). If they cannot reach the enemy, they will throw rocks. They are immensely strong, and can easily bash any foe into a gory paste. When it comes to habits, athachs are not a great deal different from the brutality and dumbness of other giants, and are likely only regarded as aberrations due to the distinctly unusual features of 3 arms and poison. Athach language is a crude form of Giant. Athachs are usually chaotic evil in alignment. In Scottish folklore \"athach\" is a general term for various monsters (including giants) that are regarded as dangerous or hostile to human beings. These include among others the luideag (a female demon), the bocan or bauchan (a mischievous hobgoblin), and the fachan or direach, a grotesque one-eyed giant with one arm and one leg. \\n Other publishers \\n The athach appeared in Paizo Publishing\\\\\\'s book Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Bestiary 2 (2010), on page 33.\\'b\\' \\n William Keen \\n William Keen (c. 1680s 29 September 1754) was a sheep merchant in St. John\\\\\\'s who became the first resident judicial officer in the British colony of Newfoundland. \\n Biography \\n Keen was an English resident of Boston, Province of Massachusetts Bay; little is known about his life in Boston. In 1704, he moved to St. John\\\\\\'s, Newfoundland to act as an agent for New England merchants operating in the area. He eventually became a trader himself and he became a wealthy and significant property owner in St John\\\\\\'s, Harbour Grace, and Greenspond. From 1699 to 1729, Newfoundland courts consisted solely of \"fishing Admirals\" who travelled to the island from England during the summers with the fishing fleets. Persons who committed capital offences were required to travel to England for trial, and no judicial officers were present in Newfoundland during the winters. By 1720, this situation had led to a high crime rate in St. John\\\\\\'s and the British government appointed Keen as the first \"winter\" justice of the peace who would conduct judicial business while the fishing Admirals were away. In practice, Governor Henry Osborn allowed Keen and the other justices of the peace who were appointed to hear cases year round. There were many disputes between the justices of the peace and the fishing Admirals, and Keen became the leader of a movement to officially establish a permanent judiciary in Newfoundland. He was a close advisor to many of the governors of Newfoundland, most of whose tenure lasted only a few years. In 1750, the British government decided that justices of the peace in St John\\\\\\'s could sit in judgment as \"commissioners\" over all cases except treason, although they could only do so if the governor was present in Newfoundland. Keen was the first such commissioner to be appointed. On 9 September 1754, Keen was attacked in his bed at his summer home when he awoke during a burglary. He was beaten with a scythe and the butt of a musket and died of his injuries in St. John nearly three weeks later. Eight men and one woman, Eleanor Power, were convicted of his murder before the court that Keen had presided over; four, including Power, were executed for the crime. Keen\\\\\\'s son, William, inherited his property and his position as commissioner. William Keen, Jr. moved to England in 1760, but the Keen family retained property in St. John\\\\\\'s and Harbour Grace until 1839.\\'b\\' \\n Kim Tae-ho (footballer) \\n Career \\n He was selected by Chunnam Dragons in the 2013 K League draft.

At the time of the Domesday survey, the Shropshire and Herefordshire boundary divided the village. The Norman magnate Roger de Montgomery held the village from the King. He built many castles including Montgomery, Shrewsbury, Ludlow, Clun, Hopton and Oswestry; at the time over 90 per cent of the lordships and manors of Shropshire were held in Chief by him. His under-tenants in this area were Ralph de Mortimer, who held Bucknell (amongst his 123 manors with his chief domain in England being at Wigmore Castle), and William de Picot (also known as Picot de Say), with his chief domain at Clun Castle. The earth mound at The Olde Farm in Bucknell is the remains of a Norman motte castle situated on the banks of the River Redlake, close to a river crossing point and to the Parish Church. In an Act of Parliament was passed transferring the whole of Bucknell to the county of Shropshire. The Lords of the Manor at that time were the Sitwell family. Historically, most of the male population worked in agriculture and timber. \\n Buildings \\n The earliest of the existing buildings date back to the 17th century. The houses were built in a haphazard fashion near the river with easy access to water. The village depended on water from the river and wells until the 1920s when water was piped into the village from a spring above Chapel Lawn. The houses at the lower end of the village were very susceptible to flooding, and this hazard continued until the ford was walled up in the 1950s. Bucknell had four pubs: The Sitwell Arms, The Plough (just opposite), The Railway Tavern and The Bridge End. The latter three are all now private houses, though a new pub, the Baron of Beef, is now open. Bucknell also had a shop and bakery in the Square and its own corn mill which was at the west end of the village. Bucknell Post office opened in the mid-19th century. The original post office was just round the corner and still goes by the name of The Old Post Office. The butcher\\'s shop is still on its original site. After World War I a Memorial Hall was built in the village, originally from a mess hut removed from a Canadian Army camp, and still stands. It contains plaques in memory of men from the parish who died serving in the World Wars. One of those behind its construction was William Burgoyne. \\n Services \\n Today the village boasts an impressive number of businesses and public services for its size: two public houses, a post office, a butcher, a petrol forecourt and shop, a general store open every day, a railway station, a primary school and numerous companies providing services to local agricultural and forestry enterprises. \\n The school \\n The Old School House was built in the 16th century, this part being the part of the building next to the river to provide education for those who could pay for it. The school remained until the present one was built in 1865. The Old School House then became a shop and bakers before becoming a private dwelling. The front part of the building pre-dates the rear by around 200 years making it 13th/14th century and whilst being restored was found to have once existed as a ground floor-only property and evidence of an open fire pit and an opening in the roof to allow the smoke to escape; this pre-dates the inglenook fireplace to the rear and was believed to have been a medieval great hall. Restoration was completed in 1999. The land upon which the present school was built was given in 1865. The first schoolmaster appointed in 1867 to the new St Mary\\'s National School was Mr Henry Evans, 24 years old. The school was extensively re-modelled in 1966 when additional teaching space and a kitchen was added enabling meals to be cooked on the premises. St Mary\\'s school is a maintained Church of England primary school with 43 pupils on roll at January 2004. The age range is years. An independent school, Bedstone College, is also nearby. \\n Population \\n Despite more houses, the number of people living in Bucknell has dropped. The population of the village in 1811 Census was 226. At the end of the 19th century this had risen to 546. In the 1981 Census the population of the village was 494; in 1991 the population of the parish (probably including Bedstone) was 601 consisting of some 250 dwellings and in 2001 it was 642 in 294 dwellings. \\n Transport \\n The village has a railway station on the Heart of Wales Line. There are nine trains a day on weekdays and eight on Saturdays, five/four to Shrewsbury and four to Swansea (plus two each way on Sundays). There is also a bus service to Knighton and Ludlow. \\n Bucknell F.C. \\n An association football club exists in the Bucknell play in the Mid Wales South League (despite being based in England they currently play in the Welsh football league system). They played in the Herefordshire Football League in the season (and before that in the Mid Wales South League as now). Bucknell play at the Daffodil Lane Recreation Ground. Another Shropshire village, also in the southwest of Shropshire, have a team playing in the same league: Newcastle.\"b\" \\n Jamestown Expos \\n Jamestown Falcons \\n The Falcons played from They played in the PONY League from 1940 to 1956, and in the New League in 1957. They were affiliated with the Detroit Tigers from 1941 to 1942 and from 1944 to 1956. In 1943, they were affiliated with the St. Louis Cardinals. They were affiliated with the Pittsburgh Pirates in 1957. The team reformed in 1961 after a 3-year absence. They were called the Jamestown Tigers from the Jamestown Dodgers in 1966 and the Jamestown Braves in 1967 (reflecting their affiliations with the Tigers, Los Angeles Dodgers and Atlanta Braves respectively) before returning to the Falcons name from Ollie Carnegie was the team\\'s manager during the 1944 season. From 1941 onward, they played their home games at Jamestown Municipal Stadium, now known as Russell Dietrick Park. \\n Montreal Expos affiliate \\n The team was known as the Jamestown Expos from 1977 to 1993, although Jamestown was affiliated with Montreal in 1970 and 1971, at the time the team was called the Falcons. Major League pitcher Randy Johnson began his career with the Expos in 1985. In 1990, the television show Candid Camera planned to do a segment of minor league baseball. After consulting the front office in Montreal, Candid Camera came to Jamestown to do a prank on pitcher Bob Baxter. Only the visiting team manager, the catcher for the Expos and the other umpires knew about the prank. Host Peter Funt played as the umpire, as the catcher gave fake signals to pitcher Baxter. The Expos were relocated to Vermont after the 1993 season, eventually becoming the Vermont Lake Monsters. However, the New League has maintained a continuous presence in Jamestown, immediately relocating the Niagara Falls Rapids to Jamestown in 1994 and naming that team the Jamestown Jammers. The Jammers would last in Jamestown until the end of the 2014 season, at which point the New League left Jamestown permanently.\"b\\' \\n Jan Steen \\n Life \\n Steen was born in Leiden, a town in Southern Holland, where his well-to-do, Catholic family were brewers who ran the tavern The Red Halbert for two generations. Steen\\\\\\'s father even leased him a brewery of his own in Delft from the years 1654 until 1657. He was the eldest of eight or more children. Like his even more famous contemporary Rembrandt van Rijn, Jan Steen attended the Latin school and became a student in Leiden. He received his painterly education from Nicolaes Knupfer a German painter of historical and figurative scenes in Utrecht. Influences of Knupfer can be found in Steen\\\\\\'s use of composition and colour. Other sources of inspiration were Adriaen van Ostade and Isaac van Ostade, painters of rural scenes, who lived in Haarlem. Whether Steen actually studied with Ostade is not known. In 1648 Jan Steen and Metsu founded the painters\\\\\\' Guild of Saint Luke at Leiden. Soon after he became an assistant to the renowned landscape painter Jan van Goyen and moved into his house on the Bierkade in The Hague. On Oct 3, 1649 he married van Goyen\\\\\\'s daughter Margriet, with whom he would have eight children. Steen worked with his father-in-law until 1654, when he moved to Delft, where he ran the brewery De Slang (\"The Snake\") for three years without much success. After the explosion in Delft in 1654 the art market was depressed, but Steen painted A Burgomaster of Delft and his daughter. It does not seem to be clear if this painting should be called a portrait or a genre work. Steen lived in Warmond, just north of Leiden, from 1656 till 1660 and in Haarlem from 1660 till 1670 and in both periods he was especially productive. In 1670, after the death of his wife in 1669 and his father in 1670, Steen moved back to Leiden, where he stayed the rest of his life. When the art market collapsed in 1672, called the Year of Disaster, Steen opened a tavern. In April 1673 he married Maria van Egmont, who gave him another child. In 1674 he became president of the Saint Lucas Guild. Frans van Mieris (1635- 1681) became one of his drinking companions. He died in Leiden in 1679 and was interred in a family grave in the Pieterskerk. \\n Works \\n Daily life was Jan Steen\\\\\\'s main pictorial theme. Many of the genre scenes he portrayed, as in The Feast of Saint Nicholas, are lively to the point of chaos and lustfulness, even so much that \"a Jan Steen household\", meaning a messy scene, became a Dutch proverb (een huishouden van Jan Steen). Subtle hints in his paintings seem to suggest that Steen meant to warn the viewer rather than invite him to copy this behaviour. Many of Steen\\\\\\'s paintings bear references to old Dutch proverbs or literature. He often used members of his family as models, and painted quite a few self-portraits in which he showed no tendency of vanity. Steen did not shy from other themes: he painted historical, mythological and religious scenes, portraits, still lifes and natural scenes. His portraits of children are famous. He is also well known for his mastery of light and attention to detail, most notably in Persian rugs and other textiles. Steen was prolific, producing about 800 paintings, of which roughly 350 survive. His work was valued much by contemporaries and as a result he was reasonably well paid for his work. He did not have many Richard Brakenburgh is his work proved a source of inspiration for many painters. \\n Connection with the Rederijkers \\n In 1945, Sturla Gudlaugsson, a specialist in Dutch seventeenth-century painting and iconography and Director of the Netherlands Institute for Art History and the Mauritshuis in The Hague, wrote The Comedians in the work of Jan Steen and his Contemporaries, which revealed that a major influence on Jan Steen\\\\\\'s work was the guild of the Rhetoricians or Rederijkers and their theatrical endeavors. It is often suggested that Jan Steen\\\\\\'s paintings are a realistic portrayal of Dutch 17th-century life. However, not everything he did was a purely realistic representation of his day-to-day environment. Many of his scenes contain idyllic and bucolic fantasies and a declamatory emphasis redolent of theater. Jan Steen\\\\\\'s connection to theater is easily verifiable through his connection to the Rederijkers. There are two kinds of evidence for this connection. First, Jan Steen Steen\\\\\\'s uncle belonged to the Rhetoricians in Leiden, where Steen was born and lived a substantial part of his life. Second, Jan Steen portrayed many scenes from the lives of the Rederijkers, an example being the painting Rhetoricians at a Window of The piece is currently held in the Philadelphia Museum of Art which was established in February 1876. The humanity, humour and optimism of the figures suggest that Jan Steen knew these men well, and wanted to portray them positively. \\n Theater \\n With his lavish and moralising style, it is logical that Steen would employ the stratagems from theater for his purposes. There is conclusive evidence that the characters in Steen\\\\\\'s paintings are predominantly theatrical characters and not ones from reality. Steen\\\\\\'s numerous paintings of a theme most commonly entitled The Visit, such as the composition of in the Rijksmuseum, illustrate his theatrical approach. The story is simple: a doctor attending a young maiden discovers that she is not ill but is in fact pregnant with child. The doctor is a comical character who wears a biretta, a doublet and a small pleated ruff. In fact, he is dressed in the fashion of 1570, not 1670. In contrast, the girl wears what would be the height of fashion at the time of the painting, a Japanese-styled loose kimono robe.  This anachronism can be explained only one way: this is not a real doctor but an actor wearing a traditional theater costume. According to Gudlaugsson, would so unusual and so completely uncontemporary a costume occur as that of the doctors in [Steen\\\\\\'s] \\n Azul y Negro \\n Career \\n Azul y Negro were pioneers of synth and electropop in Spain. The debut album La Edad De Los Colores was released in 1981. The year after the album La Noche (The Night) was released, followed by the better known Digital. An international chart release, it was an instant chart success. The single \"Me Estoy Volviendo Loco\" (meaning Going Crazy) taken from the album became a hit in Europe, Japan, United States and Australia. Digital, a collection from the first two albums, included songs like \"No Tengo Tiempo\", \"La Torre de Madrid\", \"La Noche (Let\\\\\\'s Spend the night together)\".\\'b\\' \\n M1917 bayonet \\n History \\n The M1917 bayonet was used first during World War I by American soldiers on the Western Front.  A sword bayonet design, the M1917 bayonet design was based on the British Pattern 1913 bayonet, itself derived from the Pattern 1907 bayonet, which incorporated a long 17-inch blade. While designed primarily for the M1917 rifle, the bayonet was fitted for use on all the \"trench\" shotguns at the time.  Note the that the M1917 bayonet and the British Pattern 14 bayonet from which it was derived were not interchangeable, and the two transverse cuts on the M1917 grips were meant to provide easy recognition in the dark. The M1917 was used frequently during the several different Banana Wars. The U.S. continued to use the World War I-made M1917 bayonets during World War II because of large stockpiles left over. The new Trench Guns being procured and issued were still designed to use the old M1917 bayonet. The bayonet was again called on during the Korean War for issue with the various Trench guns still in service. In a strange twist of fate, in 1966 procurement orders were let for brand new production M1917 bayonets. The contracts were issued to General Cutlery of Fremont, Ohio and Canadian Arsenals Ltd., the old Long Branch Arsenal of Quebec, Canada. Stockpiles had finally run out, and new Winchester 1200 trench shotguns were being issued. These were used in limited quantities during the Vietnam War. It was not until towards the end of the Vietnam war that new Military shotguns were designed to use the newer knife bayonets. Such as the Stevens Model 77E with the M5 Bayonet, or the United States Marine Corps \"Model 870 Mark 1\" shotgun with the M7 bayonet\\'b\" \\n Spider! \\n Reception \\n Spider was generally well received by critics and viewers, with praise directed  to the series\\' simple animation, music, humour and multi-generational appeal. Spider! has gained an 8.2 rating from 44 IMDb users as of November 2016. Spider has now attracted a cult following on old children\\'s videos and DVDs. Various episodes have also been uploaded to video networking sites like YouTube and Veoh. The series has been repeated on various children\\'s television channels in the United Kingdom, such as CBeebies and Nick Jr. It was also dubbed into Scottish Gaelic as Damhan Allaidh, and shown on BBC Two Scotland in the mornings. In the United States, the series was broadcast in 1993, with American voice actors on PBS Kids, and repeated until 1997.  In Australia, the series was played on the ABC for two years from 1993 to 1994 and then on digital television on ABC2 from 2005 to 2006. In Namibia, the series was shown on NBC, and first aired on the network in 1992, as part of its lineup of children\\'s programmes during the holidays.  In Canada, the series was broadcast on cable television on its networks for children Knowledge Network in British Columbia and YTV (as part of YTV Jr.) in all states and territories and on digital television on BBC Kids. In New Zealand, the series aired on defunct channel TVNZ 6 as part of Kidzone a block for preschoolers. The series has also been sold to Hong Kong and was screened on ATV. There were also two pop up books, based on the first and tenth episodes, adapted from Richard Warner\\'s original songs by Ron van der Meer and illustrated by the director Graham Ralph. On 12 May 2005, Silver Fox Films announced it was developing a new, revived version of the series entitled Spider\\'s Silly Show. The format was to be extended from five minutes to eleven minutes, and fifty two episodes we planned. It was to be presented by Andrew Sachs, who had previously narrated William\\'s Wish Wellingtons for Hibbert Ralph Entertainment. However, the project appears to have been abandoned, as the latest information on it dates from 2005, and it has still not appeared on television.\"b\\' \\n Percy Heylyn Currey \\n Percy Heylyn Currey FRIBA (November 1864 5 March 1942) was an English architect based in Derby. \\n Life \\n He was born in November 1864, the son of Benjamin Scott Currey and Helen Heygate. He was educated at Derby School from 1875 to 1883, and was awarded the Rowland Scholarship in 1878. He married Augusta Mary Anne Emily Frederieka Leacroft on 26 September 1897 in Little Eaton, Derbyshire. From 1895 he was Diocesan Surveyor to the Diocese of Southwell. From 1903 he was in partnership with Charles Clayton Thompson, as Currey and Thompson. In 1907 he was made a Fellow of the Royal Institute of British Architects.\\'b\\' \\n Beebetown, Ohio \\n Name and history \\n In 1823, Abram Beebe, for whom the place was named, brought his wife Dorcas and nine children from Canandaigua, New York with an ox team. He purchased fifty acres on the Liverpool corner for $165.50 and built a log house. The Fullers purchased the Strongsville corner of the area and found on it a hut which had been built by hunters. It had no fireplace or chimney but they managed to live in it the first winter. The following summer, the Fullers built the first frame house in Beebetown. Mrs. Fuller, eager to start an orchard for the family, had brought seeds and clippings from New York State. A pear tree grew from one of these. Part of it, 140 years old, still stands. Historic sites include the Beebetown schoolhouse (now a residence), cemetery, and Beebetown Baptist Church, originally built in 1852, after a two-story log building (circa 1838) on the site was no longer suitable. Several houses within the township also date back to the 1800s.\\'b\" \\n Harold Baer Jr. \\n Education \\n Born in New York City, New York, Baer received his Bachelor of Arts degree from Hobart College in 1954, where he was a member of Phi Beta Kappa.

Most of the leaves of are reduced to bladeless sheaths around the stem, but leaf blades up to 100 centimetres long can be formed under water. The inflorescence appears at the top of the stem, and comprises branches, each of which is up to long and may be again divided into shorter branches. The flowers are in the form of spikelets, each of which is millimetres long by wide. The stems of are round in cross-section, in contrast to the triquetrous (rounded-triangular) stems of other species in the genus, such as and The stems of are also round, but is a smaller plant, less than tall, with only two stigmas per flower. \\n Distribution \\n Schoenoplectus lacustris is widespread in Europe, albeit rare in the far north, and extends eastwards into Asia as far as Mongolia. It is also found in a number of Mediterranean sites in North Africa, and has been introduced to Haiti. \\n Taxonomy \\n The species was first described by Carl Linnaeus as \"Scirpus lacustris\" in his 1753 Species Plantarum. It became part of the genus Schoenoplectus when Eduard Palla raised this from the rank of subgenus to the rank of genus in 1888. Two subspecies are recognised; the autonymic subspecies subsp. lacustris) is found throughout the range of the species, and a second, subsp. hippolyti is restricted to an area reaching from the Caucasus to the mountains of Central Asia.\\'b\\' \\n Charvet Place \\n Foundation \\n The store was founded in 1836 or in 1838 by Joseph-Christophe Charvet, known as Christofle Charvet His father Jean-Pierre, native of Strasbourg, had been \"curator of the wardrobe\" for Napoleon Bonaparte, a position created at the beginning of the Empire. The curator assisted the chamberlain or \"master of the wardrobe\", who supervised all aspects of the emperor\\\\\\'s wardrobe updating the inventories, placing orders, paying bills, and establishing regulations. This position was initially held, between 1804 and 1811 by count Augustin de When it appeared in 1811 was mismanaging the wardrobe, an inventory was requested to Jean-Pierre Charvet, and was replaced by count Henri de Turenne d\\\\\\'Aynac. Christofle\\\\\\'s uncle, Charvet, was the steward of the de Malmaison and later of the de Saint Cloud. Charvet\\\\\\'s daughter Louise Caroline Catherine Christofle\\\\\\'s first cousin, married at the age of 14 Constant, Napoleon\\\\\\'s head valet. The marriage was arranged by Napoleon himself, who signed the marriage contract. She became in 1813 a linen keeper at the de Saint Cloud, therefore responsible for making the imperial shirts. Her portrait (Figure, right) was bequested to the Malmaison museum in 1929 by Charvet. Constant and his wife Louise did not to follow Napoleon in his exile to Elba, an \"enormous mistake\" according to Christofle\\\\\\'s father.  Instead, they moved to Elbeuf and invested in a weaving factory, created by Louise\\\\\\'s brother Jean-Pierre and specialized in novelty fabrics for pants and lady coats. Christofle Charvet created the first shirtmaker store in Paris, for which the new term chemisier (shirtmaker) was coined. Previously, shirts were generally made by linen keepers with fabric provided by the customer, but in this store of a new kind, clients were measured, fabric selected and shirts made on site. The development of this specialty trade was favored by a change in men\\\\\\'s fashion, with more importance given to the waistcoat and the shirt collar, which called for more propositions for the shirt front and a technical change. Previously, shirts were cut by linen keepers entirely of rectangles and squares. There were no shaping seams and no need for shirt patterns. The new interest for a closer fitting shirt led to curving the armhole and neckline or adding a shoulder yoke, by application to the shirt of tailoring techniques. The new kind of shirt was called chemise (yoked shirt). Alan Flusser credits Christofle Charvet with the original design of a collar that could be turned down or folded, much in the manner of contemporary collars, and the concept of the detachable collar. In 1839, Charvet already had some imitators, but still the \"best supply\". The same year, Charvet held the title of official shirtmaker to the Jockey Club, a very exclusive Parisian circle,  then headed by prince Joseph Ney and inspired by count Alfred d\\\\\\'Orsay, a famous French dandy. It had about 250 members, mostly aristocrats, who, despite the name of their club, were more interested in elegance than horses. Being a member was a necessary step in order to become a lion, the term used then for a dandy. In an advertisement of March 1839, Charvet, presenting himself as the Club\\\\\\'s shirtmaker, claimed to offer \"elegance,  perfection, moderate prices\". Soon after, the claim to moderate prices was dropped (see images, right). Charvet, known as Charvet, succeeded his father Christofle in 1868. He in turn was joined in the early 20th century by his three sons, Raymond and Paul. \\n Location \\n The store was initially located on the rue de Richelieu, at 103 and later at 93. It moved to 25, place in 1877. This move reflected a shift in the center of the Parisian high society and the growing importance for fashion of both rue de la Paix, where the house of Worth had opened in 1858, and the palais Garnier against the Italien, closer to Charvet\\\\\\'s original location. Though Charvet began to offer women\\\\\\'s blouses and men\\\\\\'s suits in its new store, men\\\\\\'s shirts remained the house\\\\\\'s specialty. An American journalist, visiting the store in 1909, reported \"there were shirts of every variety and almost every color [,] artistic enough to make one long for them all, and each and every one most beautifully made.\" The store was noted for its displays, compared in 1906 to Loie Fuller performances, and Charvet paid an \"immense salary\" to the window decorator, who displayed \"each day a new series\", producing \"veritable works of art in his harmonious combinations of scarves and handkerchiefs and hosiery\". In 1921, the store moved to 8, place In 1982, it moved to its current location, at 28. Charvet remains the oldest shop on place which explains both the inclusion of the location into the firm\\\\\\'s name, and the use as a logo of the sun device, designed by Jules Hardouin-Mansart to ornate the handrails of the balconies of the Place, which was built in honor of Louis XIV, the Sun King. \\n International recognition \\n In 1855 Charvet exhibited shirts and drawers at the Paris World\\\\\\'s fair. The jury noted that Parisian shirt makers had an \"unquestionable supremacy\". Again, at the next Paris World\\\\\\'s fair, Charvet exhibited shirts, drawers, vests and handkerchieves and the Jury noted luxury shirts were a Parisian \"monopoly\". When the  king-to-be Edward VII visited the fair, he ordered Parisian shirts, as many other foreign visitors did,  and remained a loyal customer of Charvet, \"honoring him during forty years with a special kindness\" (See List of Charvet customers). Charvet created for the prince of Wales a certain style of shirt collar, the stand-up turn-down collar, also referred to as the H.R.H. collar, which became very popular at the end of the 19th century (Figure, right). In 1863, Charvet was considered the first producer of fine shirts in Paris, claiming superiority \"for taste and for elegance\" on cuffs, bib and fit. Charvet\\\\\\'s store was a \"very important\" destination for English visitors in Paris. In the following years, Charvet developed its specialization in royal trousseaux. In 1878, he won a silver medal at the World Fair and a gold medal at the 1889 Paris World\\\\\\'s fair, for which the Eiffel tower was built. When it won the latter, the jury noted: \"Fine shirts remain the property and glory of Paris. To be convinced of it, it is sufficient to give a look to the displays of the companies specialized in royal haberdashery\". Other royal patrons confirmed this princely speciality of Charvet, such as Alfonso XII of Spain (1878), Antoine, duke of Montpensier (1879), Philippe, comte de Paris (1893), and sultan Abdul Hamid II (See List of Charvet customers). The clientele of Charvet also included artists such as Charles Baudelaire, who gave a metaphysical dimension to dandyism, George Sand, whose lover Alfred de Musset never succeeded to become a member of the Jockey Club, Manet, nicknamed the \"dandy of painting\" or Jacques Offenbach, composer of La Vie Parisienne. In 1893, when he tried to enter the Verlaine had himself photographed wearing a \"very beautiful Charvet scarf\" (Figure, left). Allegedly, a gift of 100,000 francs to \"the greatest poet of our time, Verlaine\", was the stake of a bet between Edmond de Polignac and Robert de Montesquiou. Having lost the bet, Montesquiou \"naturally kept the 100,000 francs but gave Verlaine a very beautiful scarf\". Upon hearing the story, Polignac cut all relations with Montesquiou. Nevertheless, some other writers consider this story as a legend circulated by Montesquiou himself, as no document establishes the existence of this bet and Montesquiou was almost the only one in the elegant and cultured world to care for Verlaine. In 1894, an administrative report praised Charvet for constantly seeking high-novelty and setting the trend for other Parisian shirtmakers, having irreproachable manufacturing standards, and successfully enticing French factories to produce the raw materials traditionally supplied by England. After his 1897 portrait by Giovanni Boldini, Montesquiou\\\\\\'s dandyism became famous and made him a frequent subject of caricatures. In 1903, a French satirical magazine illustrated by a caricature from Sem to which Marcel Proust alluded in a letter to Montesquiou, had Montesquiou saying: \"Nobody in the world ever saw such things! Pinks, blues, lilacs, in silk, and in cobweb! Charvet is the greatest artist in the Creation.\" In a letter to Montesquiou, alludes to the caricature by Sem of Montesquiou examining products at Charvet (Figure, right). In 1905, Charvet, then also established in London, at 45 New Bond St, and \"rumored\" to be contemplating an establishment in New York,  was considered the \"foremost haberdashery of Paris and London\". Its customers included not only royalty, such as Alfonso XIII of Spain (warrant granted in 1913); Edward VIII, duke of Windsor; the French president Paul Deschanel, noted for his elegant Charvet cravats; but also members of the high society gravitating around dandies such as Robert de Montesquiou and Evander Berry Wall, or artists as Jean Cocteau, who called Charvet \"magic\" and wrote that it is \"where the rainbow finds ideas\", and his friend Sergei Diaghilev. According to Proust, whose shirts, ties and waistcoats were from Charvet, maybe by imitation of Montesquiou, the latter was \"the sign of a certain world, of a certain elegance\". Proust also spent long moments at Charvet in search of a perfect tone for his cravats, such as a \"creamy pink\". His tank tops (marcel in French) also came from Charvet. In his Remembrance of Things Past (1919), Marcel, the narrator, waiting for the appointed hour of his lunch engagement at Swann\\\\\\'s house, whiles away his time \"tightening from time to time the knot of [his] magnificent Charvet tie\". In 1908, Charvet won a Grand Prix at the London Exhibition.  In 1901, Charvet opened a laundry at 3, rue des Capucines, next to his store, considered by some to be the first established in Paris, a fact which later led some others to assume Charvet\\\\\\'s laundry business had predated shirtmaking. It was advertised as applying Pasteur\\\\\\'s and Grancher\\\\\\'s principles. In 1903, Charvet moved his \"model laundry\", to the place du Saint on premises belonging to the city of Paris, which specially authorized him in view of an innovative ozone-based process, then licensed to the Parisian hospitals. The soiled clothes, picked up at the customer\\\\\\'s house by \"special cars\", were disinfected and bleached with ozone, then placed in a revolving drum worked by electricity and soaked in a diastatic solution, in order to remove the starch and make the linen whiter, subsequently washed in soap and water, afterwards in a solution of ammonia to remove the soap, then whitened, starched, calendered and hand ironed. The process was considered a model both for the quality of the output and for the care taken of the health of the workers. A \"surprising\" amount of laundry was sent over by British customers. Like many other foreign customers, William Stewart Halsted and William H. Welch regularly sent their shirts to be laundered to Charvet in Paris. Promotional stamps were produced for this laundry business and became collectible. In 1906, a branch of the laundry was opened at 1, rue du near the During World War I, Charvet significantly reduced the price of its laundry services to keep sufficient work for all his employees. Towards the end of the war, the shortage of coal severely hit Charvet\\\\\\'s laundry activity. The \"model laundry\" of place du Saint was discontinued in 1933 when the place was restructured. Charvet shirts were imported into the United States as early as 1853 (See figure right). By 1860, Charvet\\\\\\'s shirts turnover was equally divided between luxury bespoke shirts sold in the Paris store and ready made shirts for export, particularly to Russia, Great-Britain and Havana. Also, following the custom of the time, designs and models were sold to American stores, to be locally reproduced. In the 1920s, Charvet\\\\\\'s name was associated in the United States with linen fabrics in \"startingly floreated\" patterns, used for shirt bibs and cuffs. Nevertheless, into the middle of the 20th century, Charvet was selling only bespoke shirts in the Paris store. In 1908, Charvet was the first European company to import American suits hand tailored in Chicago. The name Charvet was so well known that it became associated with a certain silk fabric for ties (See Charvet (fabric)). Charvet\\\\\\'s notability also extended to other items of clothing, such as shirts, shirtings, ties, gloves, dress suits, waistcoats (see image, left), undergarments, pocketchieves, and women\\\\\\'s waistbands or shirtwaists (See figures left), worn with special models of ties for ladies, such as one called le juge modeled after a judge\\\\\\'s lappets. The Chicago Tribune reported in 1909 that Charvet was showing \"scarf pins that match in color any scarf that may be bought and some have the same designs carried out in them done in enamel. There are also waistcoasts buttons to be worn with certain ties and there are sets of these, cufflinks, and pins, all of which exactly match\". Charvet also supplied silk bed-sheets in colours such as black, green, mauve or violet. In the early 20th century, Charvet launched a toilet water, in a rectangular beveled bottle. One of the customers for this perfume was Boy Capel, Coco Chanel\\\\\\'s lover. In 1921, two years after his accidental death, the flacon of Chanel\\\\\\'s famous perfume was produced in the image of the Charvet bottle. Like many European companies, Charvet was greatly affected by World War I: \"our looms have been destroyed, our collections pillaged, our printing blocks burned\". Nevertheless, it continued to send representatives to the United States to show collections of novelties. \\n Art Deco period \\n After 1912, with the development of the Art Deco style, Charvet, along with fashion designer Paul Poiret, started to commission art work from the French painter Raoul Dufy, the \"granddaddy of modem chic\", through the French weaver Some of the first were related to the war, such as Les or the Victory Rooster (Figure, left). This was followed by more silk squares, woven silk fabrics for vests, and printed ramie fabrics for dressing gowns and shirts. Some famous customers of the period were fashion designer Coco Chanel and the Maharadjah of Patiala who once placed a single order of 86 dozen shirts. In the late 1920s, Charvet was considered to produce \"the finest cravats in the world\", with either conservative designs or \"decidedly original\" patterns, such as postage-stamps (See below) or much more \"modernist\" patterns. At an exhibition called \"L\\\\\\'art de la soie\" held at the Galliera in Paris in 1927, Charvet presented dressing gowns and neckties in matching patterns, together with pyjamas, shirts and handherchieves. The company developed a practice of sending merchandises to its customers for approval, allowing them to select some or none and return the rest, subsequently referred to as the Charvet method. It conceived a range of free-form bold printed tie patterns which gained wide popularity in the USA. \"Its chic was in their unfussy, nonchalant bearing. To the delight of their many admirers, the Charvets\\\\\\' open settings facilitated blending with all kind of fancy suits [...] The original Charvet prints became the first, and regrettably almost the last, bold figured necktie to symbolize upper-class taste\". Some such bold Charvet Art Deco ties which had belonged to John Ringling are on display at the John and Mable Ringling Museum of Art. These patterns, for which charvet became a generic name, \"foreshadowed\" the colorful designs which became popular after the war. The company also produced beach linen robes with patterns up to two feet in diameter. In the 1930s, some window displays were made by painters as Derain or Maurice de Vlaminck. \\n Colban\\\\\\'s takeover \\n When in 1965 the Charvet heirs sought to sell the firm, they were contacted by an American buyer. The French government, knowing Charvet had been for a long time General de Gaulle\\\\\\'s shirtmaker, grew concerned. The French Ministry of Industry instructed Denis Colban, Charvet\\\\\\'s main supplier, to locate a French buyer. Rather than approaching investors he decided to purchase the company himself. Until then, Charvet was operated in much the same way as it had been since its foundation: a customer was shown only what he requested, in most cases something fairly conservative. After Mr. Colban bought the firm, things changed. The change started when Baron Rothschild came into the store and asked to see some shirting fabrics, one of which was pink. When M. Colban, following previous Charvet practice, advised against the color, the Baron retorted, \"If not for me, who is it for?\" Some time later, Nelson Rockefeller requested some shirt swatches be sent to New York. Bold stripes and unusual colors were sent and eventually selected. Colban had changed Charvet\\\\\\'s policies as well as its role in the design process with the customer. A wide range of products was put on display, transforming the store in a \"veritable casbah\" of colors and \"almost edible\" fabrics. Colban also brought significant changes to the aspect of the store, having all the venerable furniture varnished in black. He created new lines of products and started ready-to-wear finely made shirts for men and women. A few years after, he was one of the first of many famous European shops and designers to sell ready-to-wear shirts, ties and accessories to Bergdorf Goodman. However, even while developing these new pre-made lines of products, Colban always insisted on the bespoke aspect of the firm as its core identity. He emphasised that \"the essential hardest of all to accomplish in today\\\\\\'s world of quick and easy pseudo solutions, is an atmosphere of \\\\\\'yes\\\\\\' to the customer and, even more, a respect for that commitment\", re-iterating the focus of Charvet on its bespoke business. Colban refused numerous offers to sell the company, maintaining the single store in Paris and continuing the house as a family business. After his death in 1994, the company has been managed by his two children, Anne-Marie and Jean-Claude. Modern customers include French presidents Mitterrand and Jacques Chirac, American presidents John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan, French actors Catherine Deneuve and Philippe Noiret, American movie stars Sofia Coppola and Bruce Willis, fashion designers Yves Saint Laurent and Jasper Conran (See also: List of Charvet customers.). \\n Charvet today \\n Of the five most prominent French shirtmakers of the 20th Charvet, Poirier, Seelio, and but Charvet have closed their doors. It is also the only remaining shirtmaker on Place The goal of the company is to give its customers the option to custom order or customize everything it sells, from neckwear (including bow ties) to underwear, with \"the idea that a garment that carries a personal stamp exceeds any other form of luxury\".  Bolts of fabric on display throughout the store can be held against oneself to see how they really look. Charvet creates exclusive fabrics for all its collections and prides itself of going a long way to satisfy customers, remaking on request ties purchased years earlier or changing a shirt\\\\\\'s frayed collar and cuffs. \\n Store \\n The store is located in one of the particuliers of Place Number 28. This building has a three-story Jules Hardouin Mansart facade, behind which Charvet occupies seven floors, each owner on the Place having built to his own needs. This is the only store directly operated by Charvet. It is open from to Monday through Saturday. Per Denis Colban\\\\\\'s merchandising ideas, the ground floor offers a contrast between the formality of the setting and the seemingly informal abundance of silk accessories, from ties to scarves to the \"signature\" silk passementerie-knot cufflinks invented here. Each necktie comes in at least two dozen colorways and new designs arrive each week. Ready-to-wear shirts and at-home clothing are displayed on the fourth floor, ready-to-wear blouses on the second floor, and children\\\\\\'s shirts on the first floor, but the third floor is dedicated to bespoke shirtmaking. This \"centre of the universe for shirt aficionados\" could be the largest selection of fine shirtings in the world, with over 6,000 different fabrics, including a \"legendary\" Mur des Blancs (Wall of Whites) of four hundred different white fabrics in 104 shades of white and another of two hundred solid blues. Customers can \"debate not just the shade of white, not just the choice of cuff, not just the angle, depth and proportion of the collar, but also the infinitesimal differences in the weight of the interlining in collar and cuff and how this can and should be varied between formal, semi-formal and casual shirts\". The richly colored and unique\" fabrics are presented in full bolts, not on swatch cards. Most of them are designed in-house by Charvet, for its own exclusive use  and woven from specially chosen gossypium barbadense cotton from the Nile delta. About a thousand new patterns are introduced each year, all of them registered. The Charvet stripes are often multicolored, asymmetric, thinner than English stripes, softer and subtler in the matching of shades. Men\\\\\\'s custom tailoring is on the sixth floor, which has the atmosphere of a men\\\\\\'s club. Some 4,500 bolts of fabric are on display there, and the walls are hung with 1960s\\\\\\' fashion illustrations of Dean Martin look-alikes drawn by Jean Choiselat. \\n Shirts \\n The \"unique\" care for precision and symmetry expresses French classicism and is, according to Marie-Claude Siccard, a paradigm of the care for quality in luxury products. In particular, a lot of attention is given to the regularity of stitches and the matching of patterns. On a typical striped ready-to-wear shirt and unlike most other makes, the placket is matched with the front, the face of the collar with the bottom, the collar stripes line up with the yoke stripes, the yoke stripes with the sleeve stripes, the sleeve stripes with the sleeve placket stripes, and finally the shade of yarn used for the buttonholes is matched to the stripe, the whole process creating the feeling the shirt is all one piece.  The yoke is one-piece and curved to follow the back. The left cuff is made one-quarter inch longer than the right to allow for the watch. The allowance is lower for made-to-order shirts. The cuff is made more or less wide, depending if the customer wants his watch to remain hidden under the cuff or to show. According to a Charvet representative, many customers have two different types of shirts: those for evening wear, intended to be worn with a flat watch, and the others for day wear, with a thicker watch. For men, shirt tails are square and vented for a clean look. For women, they are rounded, with a signature side-seam gusset. The collar is very clean-cut, made from six layers of unfused cloth for a dressy, yet not stiff, appearance.  Instead, a free floating stiffener aims to provide more comfort and a better shape. The stitching on a standard collar is four millimeters from the edge. The stitching of the top and the edges are precise and well-planned. The shirts are stitched with twin rows of single-needle tailoring, sewn one row at a time for minimum puckering and maximum fit. There are twenty stitches per inch. Buttons are made from Australian mother-of-pearl, cut from the surface of the oyster shell for added strength and greater color clarity. For formal shirts, bibs are hand pleated. Though its traditional ready-to-wear shirts are trim, the company has also introduced in 2009 a \"slim fit\" line. The care involved in the process of making a bespoke shirt is, according to Lara Marlowe, an expression of French perfectionism. It requires a minimum of 28 measurements and an initial version made in basic cotton. The fit is \"full and snug at the same time\". The minimum order is one shirt. There are only fifty shirt-makers working in the Saint-Gaultier atelier and only one person works on a shirt at a time, whether custom or ready-to-wear,doing everything except for the buttonholes and pressing the shirt. Each shirt takes thirty days to complete. \\n Pyjamas \\n The jacket is made of 14 pieces and the pants of 5. As for the shirts, patterns are matched throughout; depending on the pattern complexity, the production time is between 7 and 9 hours. Charvet pyjamas are, according to Simon, a cult object. \\n Neckwear \\n Charvet ties, ranked as the best designer\\\\\\'s ties in the US, are handmade, generally from a thick multicolor brocade silk, of a high yarn count, often enhanced by the addition of a hidden color, producing a dense fabric which goes through a proprietary finishing to acquire lustre, fluidity and resilience and achieve the right knot. The company develops its own exclusive patterns and colors. It creates about 8,000 models per year, Jacquard woven on exclusive commission, with silk either alone or mixed with other precious yarns, such as cashmere,  camel hair, bamboo yarn or covered with laminated precious metals, such as silver, gold or platinum, with techniques dating back to the 14th century when the popes were based in Avignon, which were also used in the 1920s for vests. Further to a long history of brocade patterns, first used in the 19th century for vests and then for ties, Charvet offers, according to Bernhard Roetzel, the largest range of woven silk neckties in the world. The ties collection, sometime \"unmistakably bold\" or \"witty [and] wicked\", often noted for its shimmer and changing colors (Charvet ties\\\\\\' shimmer \"has become so synonymous with the company that we call it the Charvet effect\", says a retailer.), uses about 5,000 shades in over 100,000 combinations. Ties are made from three pieces of silk material cut at a 45-degree angle. They are sewn entirely by hand before being hand folded into shape. Sevenfold ties are available on order. Until the 1960s, nearly all Charvet ties were sevenfold. The company then decided an interlining could bring an improvement, helping protect the shape despite the pulling, and designed a proprietary interlining \"which helps the silk keep its resilience and spring, but is not an obstruction when you tie a knot\". The company produced a range of political ties for the 2008 American presidential campaign. During the 1950s, it invented a special style of bow tie, a cross between a batwing and a butterfly, for the Duke of Windsor, now referred to as the \"Charvet cut\". The eponymous style 30 of the book on the 188 styles of tie knots is a three layered bow-tie worn by a woman, the constitutive ribbons being stitched together behind the neck. \\n Suits \\n Following the traditional bespoke process, measurements are taken, a basted canvas is built around the customer, then disassembled and traced onto paper, after which there are two more fittings. The suit is hand-sewn. \\n Clients \\n For various reasons, some customers, such as Charles Haughey or Bernard-Henri \"became synonymous with Charvet\".\\'b\\' \\n Edward J. Blythin \\n Life and career \\n Blythin was born October 10, 1884, in the small village of Newmarket in Flintshire, Wales, United Kingdom. His father was a farmer.  Relatively well-educated, he became a bookkeeper for a coal company in Wales. In 1906, he emigrated, ending up in Cleveland, Ohio, where he landed another bookkeeping job, for a real estate agency, a job he held for 10 years. During this time, he attended Cleveland Law School at night, earning his law degree in 1916. Blythin then turned to the practice of law. In 1935, Blythin accepted appointment as an assistant to the Cleveland city law director. He became law director in 1940. In January 1941, when Harold H. Burton resigned as Cleveland mayor in order to take a seat in the United States Senate, Blythin, as law director, automatically succeeded Burton to the mayor\\\\\\'s office. In November, however, Blythin failed to win election to the seat, losing to Democrat Frank Lausche. In 1943, Blythin left private law practice to accept an executive position at Western Reserve University. In 1949, Blythin was elected to a judgeship in the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas, where he served until his death. During his tenure on the court, Blythin presided over the notorious 1954 murder trial of Sam Sheppard.  His stewardship of the trial was later overturned by the United States Supreme Court which termed the trial \"a Roman Holiday.\"  In fact, famous columnist Dorothy Kilgallen reputedly wrote that in a private conference just prior to the trial beginning, Blythin told her, in his opinion, Sheppard was guilty. According to friends and family members, this private conference never occurred but was Ms Killgallen\\\\\\'s retaliation for the judge admonishing her for showing up late and disrupting the court proceedings. However, the appellate record contains affidavits signed by others who claimed to have heard Judge Blythin make statements similar to the statement Killgallen claimed to have heard. \\n Personal life and death \\n Blythin married Jane Rankin on April 3, 1913, and they had five children, Robert, Arthur, Glen, Jane, and William. Judge Blythin suffered a severe heart attack at his home in Parma Heights, Ohio, on February 12, 1958. He was admitted to Lutheran Hospital in Cleveland, where he suffered a second heart attack and died on February 14.  He was buried in Lake View Cemetery in Cleveland.\\'b\\' \\n Kormos \\n Kormos or Kormoz (Turkish: or are spirits in Turkish mythology and can also refer to ghosts or demons. \"Kormos\" means in Turkic languages \"does not see\" or \"blind.\" \"Blind\" is also understood of as \"mentally ill\". Among Siberia Turkic mythology, Kormos is a devilish entity, living in the underworld. Since the souls after death can turn into Kormos, they are often associated with ancestral spirits. Yakuts apply Yor for the unsatisfied dead, who roam the earth. Other names are used for them are Alban, Ozor, and more.  The good souls protect their families and are under command. The evil souls, who commonly dwell in the underworld, are controlled by Erlik. A third type of ghosts are those who are neither good nor evil, but simply suffering in a pathetic state.  Demonic Kormos, also called \"Sokor (blind angel), are the servants sent by Erlik to harm people and attempt to pull them into the underworld. However, if good outweighs the evil in this soul, the soul can escape the Kormos and ascend to heaven. \\n Yor \\n They are believed to live underground. They are evil spirits. Sometimes they go to earth and give people various damages. They are often mentioned in the beliefs of the Yakuts. \\n Alban \\n They consist of the souls of people who have committed suicide. She has inverted eyes, and has long hairs. \\n Cahik \\n They are the spirits of damned people. They can change shape. Their bloody hands, their dry eyes and their deadly talk are considered as dangerous. \\n Ozor \\n Expression for the ancestors\\\\\\' spirits. They can come and help people. Ancestor spirits have a very important place in Turkish and Mongolian culture.\\'b\" \\n German submarine U-287 \\n Design \\n German Type VIIC submarines were preceded by the shorter Type VIIB submarines. U-287 had a displacement of 769 tonnes (757 long tons) when at the surface and 871 tonnes (857 long tons) while submerged. She had a total length of a pressure hull length of a beam of a height of and a draught of The submarine was powered by two Germaniawerft F46 four-stroke, six-cylinder supercharged diesel engines producing a total of 2,800 to 3,200 metric horsepower (2,060 to 2,760 to for use while surfaced, two AEG GU double-acting electric motors producing a total of 750 metric horsepower for use while submerged. She had two shafts and two propellers. The boat was capable of operating at depths of up to 230 metres The submarine had a maximum surface speed of 17.7 knots and a maximum submerged speed of 7.6 knots When submerged, the boat could operate for 80 nautical miles at 4 knots when surfaced, she could travel 8,500 nautical miles at 10 knots U-287 was fitted with five torpedo tubes (four fitted at the bow and one at the stern), fourteen torpedoes, one SK C/35 naval gun, 220 rounds, and two twin C/30 anti-aircraft guns. The boat had a complement of between forty-four and sixty. \\n Service history \\n U-287 served with the 24th U-boat Flotilla for training from September 1943 to February 1945 and operationally with the 31st flotilla from 1 March. The boat\\'s only patrol was preceded by two short voyages from Kiel in April 1945 to Horten Naval Base and Kristiansand in Norway (the former being located northeast of Kristiansand). \\n Patrol and loss \\n The boat departed Kristiansand on 29 April 1945 and was stayed in the Elbe estuary. The whole crew but four evacuated on lifeboats to Altenbruch before the remaining crew scuttled the ship near Schelenkuhlen in the Elbe river on 16 May. They testified that they were sunk by a mine, which was documented as the official reason of loss.\"b\\' \\n Chilton Allan \\n Chilton Allan (April 6, 1786 September 3, 1858) was a United States Representative from Kentucky. He was born in Albemarle County, Virginia before moving with his mother to Winchester, Kentucky in 1797. He attended the common schools, and also received private instructions. After this, he served an apprenticeship of three years as a wheelwright, studying law in his leisure time. He was admitted to the bar in 1808 and commenced practice in Winchester, Kentucky. Allan was a member of the Kentucky House of Representatives in 1811, 1815, 1822, and 1830 and a member of the Kentucky Senate He was elected as an Anti-Jacksonian to the Twenty-second and Twenty-third Congresses and reelected as a Whig to the Twenty-fourth Congress (March 4, 1831 March 3, 1837). In Congress, he served as chairman, Committee on Territories (Twenty-third Congress) but was not a candidate for renomination in 1836. After leaving Congress, he was appointed president of the Kentucky board of internal improvements in 1837 and served until 1839, when he resigned. He resumed the practice of law and was again a member of the Kentucky House of Representatives in 1842. He died in Winchester, Kentucky in 1858 and was buried in Winchester Cemetery.\\'b\" \\n AMC MET Medical College \\n Introduction \\n AMC MET Medical College is a medical college in Maninagar, Ahmedabad. The college was established in 2009 and is maintained by the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation\\'s Medical Education Trust. It is affiliated to the Gujarat University and the Sheth L.G. hospital (Sheth Lallubhai Gordhandas Municipal Hospital, Maninagar, Ahmedabad). The foundation stone of the college was laid by the prime minister Narendra Modi, who the MLA from the Maninagar constituency at that time. The college enrolls 200 students every year for the undergraduate MBBS course. The post graduation seats in the non-clinical branches were approved in 2014 by the Medical Council of India.Clinical seats for post graduation also passed in 2016 by Medical Council of India which is 28 in number. Now, AMC MET MEDICAL COLLEGE has increased PG seats which are 108 in number. Sheth LG Hospital has 750 beds and AMC MET MEDICAL COLLEGE is affiliated to this hospital.Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation was next to Mumbai Municipal Corporation to establish Smt. NHL Municipal Medical College of its own in 1963. From this humble beginning, it has now blossomed into another medical college at LG Hospital Campus to grow as one of the most advanced and prestigious medical colleges in the country. The Medical College is affiliated to Gujarat University and Medical Council of India has granted permission to run the M.B.B.S. course. The objective of the college is not only to produce a good doctor but good citizen with empathy for poor patients.In the rating published by The Week (Indian magazine), this institute was amongst top 15 medical institutes of the country. The college has all the necessary infrastructure and facilities for pre and para clinical departments e.g. laboratories, dissection hall with adequate number of cadavers, museums, lecture halls with teaching aids, multimedia LCD projectors etc. To keep abreast with the recent advances, college has a library with more than 16000 books, journals and computer lab with internet facility and two reading halls of capacity of 150 seats. For recreation, facility of gymkhana and canteen are also available. Sheth LG General Hospital is the teaching hospital attached to the college which is a 750 bedded hospital having all the Departments e.g. Medicine & allied, Surgery & allied, Orthopedics, Pediatrics, Obstetrics & Gynecology, plastic surgery etc. It has got facility for emergency care and intensive care of the patients in form of Medical ICU, Pediatric ICU, Surgical ICU and Neonatal ICU, operation theatres, Radiology & Clinical Laboratory departments. The hospital also runs centre for providing family welfare services, Suraksha clinic (for STI and HIV/AIDS cases), ICTC and PPTCT centres. \\n OASIS \\n Every year, the college hosts annual function namely OASIS - QUENCH THE THIRST OF THRILL. OASIS - it was started as an intra-college competition in 2010, has now turned into a great festival. The latest edition of OASIS was Oasis 2019, held in March 2019 featuring Sunidhi Chauhan. In Oasis 2018, Gujarat had the high-voltage concert by Guru Randhawa for the very first time in Gujarat. In Oasis 2017, There was a concert by Aditi Singh Sharma.\"b\\' \\n Wasco Airport \\n History \\n Wasco Auxiliary Field or Wasco Field No. 1 was a satellite airfield of Minter Field, built for World War 2 pilot training. The Vultee BT-13 Valiant and Boeing-Stearman Model 75 were the most common plane used for training at Wasco Auxiliary Field and the Minter Army Airfields. The US Army leased the small 1932 40 acres Wasco Airport and 120 acres north of the airport from Kern County on June 16 1941. Minter Field was 12 miles to the southeast of Wasco Field. The Army built a 5 runway landing mat on the site, with no other improvements. In 1944 Pond Field was closed and the lease ended on June 30, 1951. The Wasco Auxiliary Field became the Wasco-Kern County Airport.\\'b\\' \\n Topps Meat Company \\n Controversy \\n 21.7 million pounds of frozen ground beef products produced between September 25, 2006, and September 25, 2007, by the Topps Meat Company were recalled in September 2007 due to Escherichia coli O157:H7 contamination concerns. At the time, this was the second-largest beef recall in U.S. history, after Hudson Foods Company\\\\\\'s recall of 25 million pounds of ground beef in 1997. Product samples subsequently tested positive for contamination with E. coli. The first reported case of illness linked to the contamination occurred on July 5, 2007. On October 4, 2007, a class-action lawsuit was filed against Topps Meat over the contaminated meat and its consequences. Also on October 4, 2007, the USDA served Topps Meat with a \"notice of intended enforcement\" (which is a move just short of suspending the rest of the meat production) because of \"inadequate process controls\" also in the non-ground beef production processes. On October 5, 2007, Topps Meat ceased operations; 77 workers were laid off while about 10 others remained employed to assist the USDA\\\\\\'s investigation. \"In one week we have gone from the largest U.S. manufacturer of frozen hamburgers to a company that cannot overcome the economic reality of a recall this large,\" Anthony D\\\\\\'Urso, chief operating officer, said in a statement. USDA\\\\\\'s first positive test results for E. coli contamination came back September 7, 2007, but they waited for confirming tests before ordering a recall 18 days later. Criticism of that 18-day delay in seeking the recall of millions of pounds of tainted Topps Meat ground beef caused the USDA to promise to speed up warnings about contaminated meat in the future. As of October 7, 2007, 29 people in eight states had fallen ill after consuming hamburgers made by Topps Meat Co.\\'b\\' \\n John Hunter (surgeon) \\n Early life \\n Hunter was born at Long Calderwood, the youngest of ten children.  The exact date of his birth is uncertain; Robert Chamber\\\\\\'s \"Book of Days\" (1868) gives an alternative birth date of 14 July, and Hunter is recorded as always celebrating his birthday on this date rather than 13 July as shown in the parish register of the town of his birth.  Family papers cite his birthday as being variously on 7 and 9 February. Three of Hunter\\\\\\'s siblings (one of whom had also been named John) died of illness before he was born. An elder brother was William Hunter, the anatomist. As a youth, John showed little talent, and helped his brother-in-law as a cabinet-maker. \\n Education and training \\n When nearly 21 he visited William in London, where his brother had become an admired teacher of anatomy. John started as his assistant in dissections (1748), and was soon running the practical classes on his own.  It has recently been alleged that Hunter\\\\\\'s brother William, and his brother\\\\\\'s former tutor William Smellie, were responsible for the deaths of many women whose corpses were used for their studies on pregnancy. John is alleged to have been connected to these deaths, since at the time he was acting as William\\\\\\'s assistant.  However, persons who have studied life in Georgian London agree that the number of gravid women who died in London during the years of Hunter\\\\\\'s and Smellie\\\\\\'s work was not particularly high for that locality and time; the prevalence of pre-eclampsia a common condition affecting 10% of all pregnancies, and one which is easily treated today, but for which no treatment was known in Hunter\\\\\\'s time would more than suffice to explain a mortality rate that seems suspiciously high to 21st-century readers. In The Anatomy of the Gravid Uterus Exhibited in Figures, published in 1774, Hunter provides case histories for at least four of the subjects illustrated. Hunter heavily researched blood while bloodletting patients with various diseases. This helped him develop his theory that inflammation was a bodily response to disease, and was not itself pathological. Hunter studied under William Cheselden at Chelsea Hospital and Percival Pott at St. Bartholomew\\\\\\'s Hospital.  Hunter also studied with Marie Marguerite a famous anatomist and wax modeler teaching in London; some of the illustrations in his text were likely hers.   After qualifying, he became assistant surgeon (house surgeon) at St George\\\\\\'s Hospital (1756) and surgeon (1768). \\n Army surgeon \\n Hunter was commissioned as an Army surgeon in 1760 and was staff surgeon on expedition to the French island of Belle in 1761, then served in 1762 with the British Army. Contrary to prevailing medical opinion at the time, Hunter was against the practice of \\\\\\'dilation\\\\\\' of gunshot wounds.  This practice involved the surgeon deliberately expanding a wound with the aim of making the gunpowder easier to remove.  Although sound in theory, in the unsanitary conditions of the time it increased the chance of infection, and Hunter\\\\\\'s practice was not to perform dilation \\\\\\'except when preparatory to something else\\\\\\' such as the removal of bone fragments. \\n Post-Army career \\n Hunter left the Army in 1763, and spent at least five years working in partnership with James Spence, a well-known London dentist.  Although not the first person to conduct tooth transplants between living people, he did advance the state of knowledge in this area by realising that the chances of a successful tooth transplant would be improved if the donor tooth was as fresh as possible and was matched for size with the recipient.  These principles are still used in the transplanation of internal organs.  Although donated teeth never properly bonded with the recipients\\\\\\' gums, one of Hunter\\\\\\'s patients stated that he had three which lasted for six years, a remarkable period at the time. Hunter set up his own anatomy school in London in 1764 and started in private surgical practice. \\n Earl\\\\\\'s Court house \\n In 1765, Hunter bought a house near the Earl\\\\\\'s Court district in London.  The house had large grounds which were used to house a collection of animals including \\\\\\'zebra, Asiatic buffaloes and mountain goats\\\\\\', as well as jackals. In the house itself, Hunter boiled down the skeletons of some of these animals as part of research on animal anatomy. A newspaper article reported that many animals there were \\\\\\'supposed to be hostile to each other but . . . in this new paradise, the greatest friendship prevails\\\\\\', and this image may have been the inspiration for the Doctor Dolittle literary character. \\n Self-experimentation \\n Hunter was elected as Fellow of the Royal Society in 1767.  At this time he was considered the leading authority on venereal diseases, and believed that gonorrhea and syphilis were caused by a single pathogen. Living in an age when physicians frequently experimented on themselves, he was the subject of an often-repeated legend claiming that he had inoculated himself with gonorrhea, using a needle that was unknowingly contaminated with syphilis. When he contracted both syphilis and gonorrhea, he claimed it proved his erroneous theory that they were the same underlying venereal disease.  The experiment, reported in Hunter\\\\\\'s A Treatise on the Venereal Diseases (part 6 section 2, 1786), does not indicate self-experimentation; this experiment was most likely performed on a third party. Hunter championed treatment of gonorrhea and syphilis with mercury and cauterization. Because of Hunter\\\\\\'s reputation, knowledge concerning the true nature of gonorrhea and syphilis was set back, and his theory was not proved to be wrong until 51 years later through research by French physician Philippe Ricord. \\n Late career \\n In 1768, Hunter was appointed as surgeon to St George\\\\\\'s Hospital. Later, he became a member of the Company of Surgeons.  In 1776, he was appointed surgeon to King George III. In 1783, Hunter moved to a large house in Leicester Square. The space allowed him to arrange his collection of nearly 14,000 preparations of over 500 species of plants and animals into a teaching museum. The same year, he acquired the skeleton of the 2.31 m (7\\\\\\' 7\") Irish giant Charles Byrne against Byrne\\\\\\'s clear deathbed had asked to be buried at sea. Hunter bribed a member of the funeral party (possibly for and filled the coffin with rocks at an overnight stop, then subsequently published a scientific description of the anatomy and skeleton. \"He is now, after having being stolen on the way to his funeral,\" says Muinzer, \"on display permanently as a sort of freak exhibit in the memorial museum to the person who screwed him over, effectively.\" The skeleton, today, with much of Hunter\\\\\\'s surviving collection, is in the Hunterian Museum at the Royal College of Surgeons in London. In 1786, he was appointed deputy surgeon to the British Army and in March 1790, he was made surgeon general by the then Prime Minister, William Pitt.  While in this post, he instituted a reform of the system for appointment and promotion of army surgeons based on experience and merit, rather than the patronage-based system that had been in place. Hunter\\\\\\'s death in 1793 was due to a heart attack brought on by an argument at St George\\\\\\'s Hospital concerning the admission of students. He was originally buried at St Martin-in-the-Fields, but in 1859 was reburied in the north aisle of the nave in Westminster Abbey, reflecting his importance to the country. Hunter\\\\\\'s character has been discussed by biographers: His nature was kindly and generous, though outwardly rude and repelling.... Later in life, for some private or personal reason, he picked a quarrel with the brother who had formed him and made a man of him, basing the dissension upon a quibble about priority unworthy of so great an investigator. Yet three years later, he lived to mourn this brother\\\\\\'s death in tears. He was described by one of his assistants late in his life as a man \\\\\\'warm and impatient, readily provoked, and when irritated, not easily soothed\\\\\\'. \\n Family \\n In 1771, he married Anne Home, daughter of Robert Boyne Home and sister of Sir Everard Home.  They had four children, two of whom died before the age of five.  One of his infant children is buried in the churchyard in Kirkheaton, Northumberland, and the gravestone is Grade II listed. Their fourth child, Agnes, married General Sir James Campbell of Inverneill. \\n Legacy \\n In 1799, the government purchased Hunter\\\\\\'s collection of papers and specimens, which it presented to the Company of Surgeons. \\n Contributions to medicine \\n Hunter helped to improve understanding of human teeth, bone growth and remodeling, inflammation, gunshot wounds, venereal diseases, digestion, the functioning of the lacteals, child development, the separateness of maternal and foetal blood supplies, and the role of the lymphatic system. \\n Memorials \\n A bust of John Hunter stands on a pedestal outside the main entrance to St George\\\\\\'s Hospital in Tooting, South London, along with a lion and unicorn taken from the original Hyde Park Corner building, Lanesborough House. A bust of him is in the south-west corner of Lincoln\\\\\\'s Inn Fields. A bust also stood in Leicester Square near where his central London home and anatomy school were situated, but was removed between 2010 and 2012, and has not yet been re-instated. The John Hunter Clinic of the Chelsea and Westminster Hospital in London is named after him. The John Hunter Hospital in Newcastle, Australia, is also named in honour of him. His birthplace in Long Calderwood, Scotland, has been preserved as Hunter House Museum.

Anti-fascist protesters, including local Jewish, socialist, anarchist, Irish and communist groups, clashed with the Metropolitan Police, who attempted to remove the barricades erected to stop the march. \\n Creation \\n Planning for the mural began in 1976, when Dan Jones, Secretary of the Hackney Trades Council, saw the Royal Oaks Mural under the Westway in west London, and asked the artist, Dave Binnington, to paint a mural in Cable Street. A grant from the Arts Council allowed Binnington to undertake research before a public meeting in October 1978 to unveil his design.  The local population were generally supportive, although a letter to a local paper described the proposed mural as \"political graffiti\". Binnington also recruited Paul Butler to design the lower section. Many of the faces in the mural were inspired by newspaper pictures of people who took part in the battle. Funding from Greater London Arts Association, the E. Vincent Harris Fund for Mural Decoration, the Gulbenkian Foundation, the Leonard Cohen Trust, Greater London Council and the Royal Academy allowed work to start. Binnington began painting in late 1979 with a targeted completion date of October 1980.  He found it more complicated and time consuming than expected, and work continued through 1980 and 1981.  The uncompleted mural was vandalised on 23 May 1982, when right-wing slogans were painted on lower parts of the wall.  Binnington abandoned the project in disgust.  He later became a furniture designer, and adopted his wife\\\\\\'s surname to become David Savage. Work resumed in July 1982 with Paul Butler helped by Ray Walker and Desmond Rochfort (who had worked with Binnington before on the Royal Oaks Mural).  The top was completed to Binnington\\\\\\'s design, and the vandalised lower portions were sand-blasted and repainted to a modified design.  The mural was completed in March 1983 and officially unveiled on 7 May 1983 by Paul Beasley, Leader of Tower Hamlets Council,with Jack Jones (former General Secretary of the Transport and General Workers Union), Tony Banks (Chair of the Greater London Council Arts Committee) and Dan Jones. The mural has been vandalised and restored several times, and was restored again by Butler for the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Cable Street in October 2011. \\n Mural \\n The mural is painted on approximately 3,500 square feet of rendered wall outside 236 Cable Street, E1 0BL, next to Library Place, about 150 yards west of Shadwell railway station.  It covers about feet of one side of St George\\\\\\'s Town Hall, which was originally the vestry hall for the area and later the town hall of Stepney Borough Council. The artists used 150 imperial gallons of paint, at a cost of The work is inspired by the social realism of Diego Rivera.  Using a fisheye perspective, it shows the violent confrontation between police and protesters, with protest banners, punches being thrown, a barricade of furniture and overturned vehicle, police horse, and a police autogyro overhead.  It uses the same artistic devices as Goya\\\\\\'s The Third of May 1808 to evince sympathy for the protesters, showing them full face but a back view of the police..\\'b\" \\n Chris Auchinvole \\n Early years \\n Auchinvole was born in Prestwick, Scotland, and attended the Royal Military Academy at Sandhurst in England. In New Zealand, he has been involved with the export industry, and operated a company based on the West Coast. He has also been involved in the Uniting Church, becoming a lay preacher. \\n Retirement \\n On 2 October 2013 Auchinvole confirmed that he would be stepping down at the 2014 election. Auchinvole was replaced for the 2014 election by Maureen Pugh, Former Westland District Mayor as the West Coast-Tasman Candidate however she did not win the seat but later entered Parliament on the list following Tim Groser\\'s resignation.

Her mother died after complications in her last childbirth on 3 September 1680 and her father remarried three more times: in Doberlug on 27 October 1683 to Sibylle Maria, a daughter of Duke Christian I of Saxe-Merseburg; in Hamburg on 4 February 1695 to Sophie Wilhelmine, a daughter of Prince Enno Louis Cirksena of East Frisia and in on 6 December 1700 with Sophia, a daughter of Duke Gustav Adolph of Louise Elisabeth and her younger sister Sophie Angelika (by marriage Duchess of Saxe-Zeitz-Pegau-Neustadt) are the only surviving children from her parents\\' marriage. From her father\\'s later marriages she had eight half-siblings, of whom only three survive adulthood: Charles Frederick II, Duke of Christian Ulrich II, Duke of (both sons of Sibylle Maria) and Auguste Louise (daughter of Sophie Wilhelmine; by marriage Duchess of Saxe-Weissenfels-Barby). \\n Life \\n On 20 August 1688, at the age of 15, Louise Elizabeth married Duke Philip of as his second wife. He was 31 years old and was an elder brother of her stepmother Marie Sibylle. A medal was struck to commemorate their marriage. After the wedding, the couple resided in Merseburg, where their son Christian Louis was born on 21 July 1689. One year later (1690) and within days, she lost both her son (6 June) and her husband, when he fell during the Battle of Fleurus on 1 July. Louise Elisabeth had followed her husband to Fleurus, and the camp where she stayed was attacked by the French. Afterwards, she had trouble journeying back to Merseburg and thence to In 1704, her father died. That same year, she moved from Castle to her widow seat in Forst. The castle in Forst had been uninhabited since Ferdinand II of Bieberstein, its last inhabitant, had died in 1667. She had it renewed and expanded and added a chapel. The great hall above the entrance gate was used as the castle chapel. Her court was managed by her High Hofmeister Carl Gottlob von Goldstein auf Passendorf und Angersdorf hsi wife, Christian Sibylle Marschall von Bierberstein assisted by two more Hofmeisters, Otto Heinrich von Vibra and Bodo Gottlieb von Koseritz. Her equerry was Hans von Bomsdorf auf Weissagk, and after his death, a Baron von Lossow. She also employed several Chambermaids, quite a few pages, a court deacon, a chaplain, a personal physician, and after 1710 a court cantor, who also supervised the pages, and a catechist, who assisted the chaplain and educated the children of her staff. She further employed a conductor and several musicians, most of whom were also lackeys, a chamber singer, a female court midget, a court manager, a quartermaster, a gardener, and a number of servants with all sorts of job titles. In 1709, she revived the Ducal Order of the Skull as a chivalric order for ladies.  Also in 1709, the first post office opened in Forst. It was housed in her palace, because of her commitment Between 1717 and 1721, her small court orchestra was directed by Christian August Jacobi (1688 after 1725). In 1718, he composed his Christmas cantata Der Himmel steht uns wieder offen for tenor solo, string emsemble, trumpet and basso continuo, first performed on Christmas Day 1718 in the court chapel.  This cantata is considered representative of the Saxon baroque music and is still performed occasionally in the Frauenkirche in Dresden. She lived in Forst until her death; she died on 28 April 1736. She was buried in the crypt of the St. Nicholas church in Forst (Lausitz). \\n Legacy \\n The in Forst was named after her.  It is close to the location of her palace, which no longer exists.  The exact location of her grave in the St. Nicholas church is unknown.\"b\" \\n DeAndre Liggins \\n High school career \\n Considered a four-star recruit by Rivals.com, Liggins was listed as the No. 6 point guard and the No. 28 player in the nation in 2008. \\n College career \\n Liggins played three years at the University of Kentucky.

Therefore, the value of smaller prizes usually totals much less than that of the top prize. Firms that rely on sweepstakes for attracting customers, such as Publishers Clearing House and Reader\\\\\\'s Digest, have also found that the more involved the entry process, the more entrants. Businesses often obtain marketing information about their customers from sweepstakes entries. Here, products are for free, and the company does not ask for specific knowledge for providing answers in the contests. \\n Regulation \\n Because of their potential for abuse, sweepstakes are heavily regulated in many countries. The US, Canada, and individual US states all have laws covering sweepstakes, so there are special rules depending on where the entrant lives. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission exercises some authority over sweepstakes promotion and sweepstakes scams in the United States. Notably, sweepstakes in Canada, Australia, and several European countries require entrants to solve an elementary-school-level mathematical puzzle or answer a fairly simple knowledge question or solve a trivial fill-in-the-blanks guessing competition, making it (in theory, at least) a contest of skill in order to overcome requirements that would classify sweepstakes as a form of gambling under their country\\\\\\'s legal definition. There are similar laws in Brazil, usually requiring an answer to an easy \"giveaway\" question. \\n Australia \\n In Australia, a sweepstake is known as a competition, however the technical name for a consumer competition is a trade promotion lottery. A trade promotion lottery is a free entry lottery conducted to promote goods or services supplied by a business. Unlike in the U.S., entrants may be required to purchase a product in order to enter a trade promotion in Australia. Companies or promoters may require a trade promotion lottery permit if the winner(s) are to be chosen via an element of chance, i.e. a competition draw. No permits are required for competitions that do not involve an element of chance in determining the winner or winners. Common examples include competitions where entrants are required to submit a photo or an answer to a question in 25 words or less. Many compers (those who enjoy entering competitions) attend annual national conventions. In 2012 over 100 people from the online competitions website lottos.com.au met on the Gold Coast, Queensland to discuss competitions. \\n Ireland and the United Kingdom \\n Sweepstakes with an entry fee are considered in the UK to be lotteries under the Gambling Act 2005. Most sweepstakes in the UK are small-scale. They are classed as work lotteries, residents\\\\\\' lotteries or private society lotteries and do not require a licence, provided that all the money staked is paid out as prize money. The popularity of the term \"sweepstakes\" may derive from the Irish Sweepstakes, which were very popular from the 1930s to the 1980s. There is a tradition of office sweepstakes (known as office pools in the U.S.), which are usually based on major sporting events such as the Grand National and the World Cup. Entrants pay an equal stake for each horse/team they draw out of the hat before the event. The winner then takes the pot. For horse racing events, the pot may be split between the horses which come first, second and third. What an American would call a \"sweepstakes\" (a random prize draw promoting a commercial product) is likely to be labelled as a \"prize draw\" or \"competition\" in the UK. In the UK, prize competitions and prize draws are free of statutory control under the Gambling Act 2005  but should follow the CAP Code. \\n United States \\n In the United States, sweepstake sponsors are very careful to disassociate themselves from any suggestion that players must pay to enter, or pay to win, since this would constitute gambling. Sweepstakes typically involve enticements to enter a consumer promotion with prizes that range from substantial wins such as cars or large sums of money to smaller prizes that are currently popular with consumers. There should be no monetary cost to the entrant (although some sweepstakes require entrants to subscribe to a promotional mailing list, potentially exposing the entrant to an increase in junk mail, spam email, or telemarketing calls) and sweepstakes winners should also not be required to pay any kind of fee to receive their prizes. As an example of a state policy on sweepstakes promotions, Tennessee residents are prohibited by a policy of the Tennessee Alcoholic Beverage Commission (and not a state law) from entering sweepstakes online sponsored by manufacturers of wines and liquors; however, Tennessee residents may enter many of these same sweepstakes promotions by entries delivered by the US Postal Service. Another example is that Tennessee state law prohibits sweepstakes agencies and sponsors from requiring sweepstakes prize winners to submit to \"in perpetuity\" publicity releases. Most corporate-sponsored sweepstakes promoted in the United States limit entry to US citizens, although some allow entry by legal residents of both the United States and Canada. Among the most popularly known sweepstakes in the United States were the American Family Publishers Sweepstakes (now defunct), Publishers Clearing House sweepstakes, and Reader\\\\\\'s Digest Sweepstakes, each of which strongly persuaded entrants to purchase magazine subscriptions by placing stickers on contest entry cardstock while promising multimillion-dollar (annuity) winners who will be \"announced on TV\". The American Family Publishers sweepstakes used paid advertisements during NBC\\\\\\'s The Tonight Show to announce its grand prize winners (for many years, its celebrity spokesman was Ed McMahon). All three companies eventually paid fines and penalties to a variety of states who initiated legal actions against them. Of those three companies, only Publishers Clearing House continues to use sweepstakes as a promotional device and as recently as 2010 paid $3.5 million to settle charges that it had violated the terms of a 2001 multi-state agreement for which it was fined $34 million. Sweepstakes are frequently used by fast-food restaurants to boost business. One of the most popular has been the McDonald\\\\\\'s Monopoly \"instant-win\" game-piece promotion (To satisfy the \"no purchase necessary\" requirement, free game pieces are made available on request through the US mail). Soft drink companies also sponsor many sweepstakes, such as the Pepsi Billion Dollar Sweepstakes game and the Pepsi Stuff loyalty rewards program that allowed Pepsi drinkers to accumulate points from packages and cups and redeem them for merchandise. Pepsi Stuff was Pepsi\\\\\\'s largest and most successful long-term promotion ever and it ran for many years in the US and in many countries around the world. Other sponsors may require the submission of a UPC of a company product (with provision for receiving a \"free\" UPC) for entry into the sweepstakes drawing. Sweepstakes parlors, which began to appear in the US around 2005, are establishments that offer chances to win cash prizes as a promotion for a product, usually either a telephone card or Internet access. Sweepstakes must be carefully planned to comply with local laws and curtail forms of entrant fraud and abuse. Before home computers were popular, a common method of entry was a mailed, plain 3\" 5\" index card with the entrant\\\\\\'s name and address. Massive computer-printed entries resulted in a new requirement that entries must be \"hand-printed\". Laser printers that can mimic ink pen writing are also a problem for sponsors. In most sweepstakes, entrants and their relatives must not be related to the sponsor or promoter. Many state lotteries also run second-chance sweepstakes in conjunction with the retail sale of state lottery scratch cards in an effort to increase consumer demand for scratch cards and help control the litter caused by the improper disposal of non-winning lottery tickets. Since lottery tickets are considered to be bearer instruments under the Uniform Commercial Code, these lottery scratch card promotions can be entered with non-winning tickets that are picked up as litter.\\'b\" \\n Station \\n Lines \\n Station is served by the Shin\\'etsu Main Line and is 44.8 kilometers from the terminus of the line at Naoetsu. \\n Station layout \\n The station consists of two ground-level opposed side platforms connected by a footbridge, serving two tracks.

It was operated by volunteers with the Yellowknife Museum Society until 1970 when care of its artifacts was transferred to the Government of the Northwest Territories. Planning for a larger institution began due to concern over the loss of northern artifacts and collections, and the need to provide museum services and support throughout the Northwest Territories under a government mandate. In 1972, a program calling for the development of museum services in the NWT received official approval from the Government of the Northwest Territories. Construction started in 1975. On April 16, 1979, His Royal Highness, The Prince Charles, Prince of Wales, officiated at the opening of the facility that bears his name. The PWNHC holds in trust for the public a large collection of objects that represent the peoples and cultures of the NWT, and produces exhibitions that tell stories about the land, people and history of the NWT. However, the PWNHC is \"more than a museum\". In addition to its exhibits, collections and conservation programs, the PWNHC houses the NWT Archives, provides technical, logistic and financial support to individuals and organizations involved in cultural activities and the arts, and authorizes archaeological studies in the NWT. \\n Authority \\n The mandate for the activities derives from the Northwest Territories Archives Act, the Northwest Territories Historical Resources Act, and the Northwest Territories Archaeological Sites Regulations. \\n Affiliations \\n The Museum is affiliated with:NWT Archives Council CMA,  CHIN, and Virtual Museum of Canada.\\'b\\' \\n The Golden Lady \\n Plot \\n Julia Hemingway (Ina Skriver, credited as Christina World), a British female mercenary, is hired by wealthy businessman Charlie Whitlock in order to help him eliminate the competition on the purchase of some oil fields in Saudi Arabia.  Hemingway coordinates a team of 3 sexy women to go undercover to complete the task, but is unaware that Whitlock plans on double crossing her so he won\\\\\\'t have to pay for her services. \\n Reception \\n Variety reviewed the film unfavourably: \"Hard to see much appeal in this cheapie, which features Danish newcomer Christina World as a distaff James Bond, but which will leave audiences neither shaken nor stirred. Action is underpowered, while sex, ever-expected, is underexploited. Script by Joshua Sinclair gets enmeshed in a pretentious plot...\" \\n Soundtrack \\n The music for the film was composed by Georges Garvarentz. The theme song to the film, \"The Golden Lady\", was performed by The Three Degrees, and was co-written by Garvarentz with lead vocalist Sheila Ferguson. It was released as a single and peaked at #56 on the UK Singles Chart in June 1979.\\'b\\' \\n Pangalan Islet \\n Location and geography \\n Pangalan Island is located 0.5 miles east of Panay Island in the Visayan Sea.

He was a member of the Politburo, a representative in the Albanian Parliament for many years, First Secretary of Party in several districts, and member of the Cabinet of Albania during 1976-79. \\n Biography \\n Asllani was born on 17 October 1937 in near in a poor family. After attending the agricultural technical school in he studied during 1961-1964 at the Agricultural Institute, now the Agricultural University of Tirana (Alb: Universiteti \\n Political career \\n The 6th Congress of the PPSh in 1968 found him following the \"V.Lenin\" Party School in Tirana. In that congress, he became a member of the Central Committee of the Party, although he was not previously a candidate. The next year he served as Secretary of the Party in switching with Prokop Murra. On January 3, 1974, he was appointed First Secretary of the Party in Mat District, before being sent as First Secretary of the Party in District. After working as a Deputy Minister of Agriculture from May 1976 to March 1979, Asllani was then First Secretary in Burrel. Shortly thereafter, he was reappointed in Asllani lead the front line of the reconstruction work that brought the town back to life after the earthquake of 1979, which destroyed and damaged a considerable number of buildings and houses. At the 8th Congress of the party in November 1981, Asllani became a member of the Politburo of the Party of Labour of Albania. He remained inside the Politburo until December 1990, when he was shifted away by Ramiz Alia, together with Lenka and Simon Stefani. During the \\\\\\'80s, Asllani served as First Secretary of the Party in Durres, the main port city of Albania. Between 1982 and 1991, respectively during the tenth and eleventh legislature, he was elected representative in the People\\\\\\'s Assembly (Alb: Kuvendi Popullor). There were rumors that Asllani\\\\\\'s son was one of many that entered the foreign embassies during Summer 1990, thus seeking political-economical refuge in the German embassy. The rumors were never verified. \\n Post-communist era \\n In 1993, a special court rose in Tirana against Asllani and nine other former high-ranking officials (Besnik Bekteshi, Foto Vangjel Hajredin Lenka Llambi Gegprifti, Qirjako Mihali, Pali Miska, and Prokop Murra). They were accused of \"abuse of public funds\". The following sentences were given: Mihali and Gegprifti eight years each, Miska and seven years each, and Bekteshi six years each, and Murra and Asllani five years. Another case against was brought in June 1996, this time for \"crimes against humanity\". Other co-defendants were the former Politburo members Prokop Murra, Foto Gaqo Nesho (former First Secretaries of PPSh of Vlora and Tirana), Zef Loka (former director in the Ministry of Internal Affairs), and Dilaver Bengasi, former Deputy Minister of the Interior. The verdict  was carried out in August 1996. Murra received 20 year in prison, Asllani and Loka 18, Nesho 16 years and Bengasi 12 years. They were all released shortly after the turmoils of 1997. Lately, Asllani was member of the Reorganised Party of Labour of Albania, and its Politburo. Nevertheless, he was expelled in May 2013 because his stance against party\\\\\\'s decision to stand pro gay rights in Albania.\\'b\\' \\n Nixon Doctrine \\n The Nixon Doctrine, also known as the Guam Doctrine, was put forth during a press conference in Guam on July 25, 1969 by President of the United States Richard Nixon and later formalized in his speech on Vietnamization of the Vietnam War on November 3, 1969. According to Gregg Brazinsky, author of \"Nation Building in South Korea: Koreans, Americans, and the Making of a Democracy\", Nixon stated that \"the United States would assist in the defense and developments of allies and friends\", but would not \"undertake all the defense of the free nations of the world.\" This doctrine meant that each ally nation was in charge of its own security in general, but the United States would act as a nuclear umbrella when requested. The Doctrine argued for the pursuit of peace through a partnership with American allies. \\n Background \\n At the time of President Nixon\\\\\\'s first inauguration in January 1969, the US had been engaged in combat in Vietnam for almost four years. The war had so far killed over 30,000 Americans and several hundred thousand Vietnamese citizens. By 1969, US public opinion had moved decisively to favoring ending the Vietnam War; a Gallup poll in May showed 56% of the public believed sending troops to Vietnam was a mistake. Of those over 50 years old, 61% expressed that belief, compared to 49% of those between ages 21 and 29, even if tacit abandonment of the SEATO Treaty was ultimately required and caused a complete Communist takeover of South Vietnam despite previous US guarantees. Because Nixon campaigned for \"Peace with Honor\" in relation to Vietnam during the 1968 presidential campaign, ending the Vietnam War became an important policy goal for him. \\n The Nixon Doctrine \\n During a stopover during an international tour on the U.S. Territory of Guam, Nixon formally announced the Doctrine. Nixon declared the United States would honor all of its treaty commitments in Asia, but \"as far as the problems of international security are concerned ... the United States is going to encourage and has a right to expect that this problem will increasingly be handled by, and the responsibility for it taken by, the Asian nations themselves\".   Later, from the Oval Office in an address to the nation on the War in Vietnam on November 3, 1969, Nixon said: First, the United States will keep all of its treaty commitments. Second, we shall provide a shield if a nuclear power threatens the freedom of a nation allied with us or of a nation whose survival we consider vital to our security.  Third, in cases involving other types of aggression, we shall furnish military and economic assistance when requested in accordance with our treaty commitments. But we shall look to the nation directly threatened to assume the primary responsibility of providing the manpower for its defense. \\n Doctrine in practice \\n The Doctrine was exemplified by the Vietnamization process regarding South Vietnam and the Vietnam War.  It also played elsewhere in Asia including Iran,  Taiwan, Cambodia  and South Korea.  The doctrine was an explicit rejection of the practice that sent 500,000 American soldiers to Vietnam, even though there was no treaty obligation to that country.  A major long-term goal was to reduce the tension between the United States and the Soviet Union and mainland China, so as to better enable the policy of to work.    The particular Asian nation the Nixon Doctrine was aimed at with its message that Asian nations should be responsible for defending themselves was South Vietnam, but Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi of Iran seized upon the Nixon Doctrine with its message that Asian nations should be responsible for their own defense to argue that the Americans should sell him arms without limitations, a suggestion that Nixon eagerly embraced. The US turned to Saudi Arabia and Iran as \"twin pillars\" of regional stability. Oil price increases in 1970 and 1971 would allow funding both states with this military expansion. Total arms transfers from the United States to Iran increased from $103.6 million in 1970 to $552.7 million in 1972; those to Saudi Arabia increased from $15.8 million in 1970 to $312.4 million in 1972. The United States would maintain its small naval force of three ships in the Gulf, stationed since World War II in Bahrain, but would take on no other formal security commitments. One factor in reducing open-ended American commitments was financial concern.  Vietnam had proven very expensive.  In South Korea, 20,000 of the 61,000 US troops stationed there were withdrawn by June 1971. The application of the Nixon Doctrine \"opened the floodgates\" of US military aid to allies in the Persian Gulf.  That in turn helped set the stage for the Carter Doctrine and for the subsequent direct US military involvement of the Gulf War and the Iraq War. \\n Contemporary usage \\n Scholar Walter Ladwig has recently argued that the United States should adopt a \"neo-Nixon doctrine\" towards the Indian Ocean region, in which the US would sponsor key local Indonesia, Australia and South assume the primary burden for upholding regional peace and security. A key shortcoming of the original Nixon Doctrine, Ladwig argues, was its reliance on pro-Western autocrats who proved to be a poor foundation for an enduring regional security structure. In contrast, his \"neo-Nixon Doctrine\" would focus on cultivating the major Indian Ocean nations that are democratic and financially capable of being net providers of security in the region. Although crediting this idea for the \"reasonable balance it strikes between US leadership and local initiative\", Andrew Philips of the Australian Strategic Policy Institute has suggested the idea overstates \"the degree of convergent security interests between its four presumptive sub-regional lynchpin states.\"\\'b\\' \\n Gmina \\n Villages \\n Apart from the town of Gmina contains the villages and settlements of Baczyna, Barycz, Bedlenko, Bedlno, Brody, Czerwony Most, Czysta, Drutarnia, Fidor, Gabrielnia, Gatniki, Gracuch, Koczwara, Kopaniny, Kornica, Modliszewice, Niebo, Nowe Nowy Nowy Nowy Paruchy, Pomorzany, Poraj, Przybyszowy, Radomek, Sielpia Wielka, Stadnicka Wola, Stara Stary Stary Stary Sworzyce, Szabelnia, Trzemoszna, and \\n Neighbouring gminas \\n Gmina is bordered by the gminas of Przysucha, Radoszyce, Ruda Maleniecka, and \\n Ethnographic Museum \\n Ethnographic Museum is a museum in western Albania.

The former moiety is not mentioned after 1480; the latter apparently followed the same descent as Wolverton. The name is now lost, and the manor is apparently merged in Bembridge Farm.\\'b\" \\n New York State Route 117 \\n Mount Pleasant and Pleasantville \\n begins just north of the village of Sleepy Hollow at an interchange with (Broadway) in the town of Mount Pleasant. The route proceeds generally northeastward along Phelps Way, a four-lane, divided highway bypass of Sleepy Hollow and Kykuit, the Rockefeller family\\'s estate. For its first 2 miles the highway runs through a wooded area along the northern edge of the Rockefeller State Park Preserve, crossing under several of the park\\'s hiking and walking trails. Phelps Way ends at the northeastern tip of the park, where intersects with the northern terminus of at Bedford Road. While ends here, Bedford Road continues on as part of After becomes a four-lane, undivided at-grade street as it heads northeast through a residential area of Mount Pleasant. Just past the junction, enters adjacent interchanges with Saw Mill River Road and and the northbound direction of the Taconic State Parkway near Graham Hills County Park. From here, the highway passes south of Pace University\\'s Pleasantville campus on its way into the village of Pleasantville, where it narrows to two lanes and initially serves mostly commercial neighborhoods. remains on Bedford Road for its first few blocks in Pleasantville; however, it veers northeast onto Manville Road just southwest of the community\\'s central business district. As Manville Road, the highway heads past five residential blocks, connecting to the southbound direction of the Saw Mill River Parkway before entering Pleasantville\\'s commercial center at Memorial Plaza. Within Memorial Plaza is Metro-North Railroad\\'s Pleasantville station, located on the south side of After crossing the Metro-North tracks, the route continues east along several commercial blocks before turning to the northeast and entering another residential section of Pleasantville. The highway eventually reaches the northern edge of the village, where it rejoins Bedford Road at a junction with the northern terminus of turns north here, following Bedford Road out of Pleasantville and into the nearby town of New Castle. \\n New Castle, Chappaqua and Mount Kisco \\n Upon crossing into New Castle, changes names to South Bedford Road. The road takes a generally northeasterly track away from the town line to the hamlet of Chappaqua, a community just 2 miles from the center of Pleasantville. serves as Chappaqua\\'s main street, passing by commercial and residential neighborhoods ahead of an intersection with (King Street) in Chappaqua\\'s center. turns north here, overlapping with for one block before splitting off to the west on Quaker Road. continues north from this point as North Bedford Road, passing a strip mall before leaving Chappaqua. Outside of Chappaqua, loosely parallels the Saw Mill River Parkway as it winds its way northeastward across residential parts of New Castle. The two parallel roads connect again by way of Roaring Brook Road, a four-lane arterial located midway between Chappaqua and the next community along the village of Mount Kisco. Roaring Brook Road also connects and the Saw Mill River Parkway to the global headquarters of Reader\\'s Digest, which comprises a large complex bounded by to the east and the Metro-North tracks to the west. From here, takes on a more pronounced northeasterly alignment that takes the route past Mount Kisco Country Club and into the village of Mount Kisco. Just inside the village limits, meets the north end of at Park Avenue. Past Park Avenue, continues north through Mount Kisco, changing names to Main Street ahead of the village\\'s central business district. Here, the route enters a junction with the western terminus of (South Bedford Road) at the main entrance to Northern Westchester Hospital. The commercial surroundings continue north for another eight blocks to Jeff Feigel Square, where connects to the east end of Main Street turns northwest onto while splits to the northeast along Bedford Road. \\n Mount Kisco, Bedford, and Bedford Hills \\n As the route heads away from Main Street, it proceeds through a brief wooded, residential area before entering a commercial district surrounding Mount Kisco Commons. Several businesses and an industrial complex follow after as continues northeast through the northernmost part of Mount Kisco and into the town of Bedford. Across the town line, the development along the route remains commercial as the road parallels the nearby railroad tracks and the Saw Mill River Parkway to the northwest. About 2 miles from Mount Kisco, enters the hamlet of Bedford Hills, where the route initially serves residential neighborhoods. In the commercial center of the community, serves the Bedford Hills Metro-North station before widening to four lanes as it crosses the railroad tracks and connects to of the Saw Mill River Parkway. For the next mile runs alongside the northern edge of the Saw Mill River Parkway as it heads through another residential part of Bedford Hills as a two-lane road. At Harris Road, the route turns southeastward, crossing the parkway and the adjacent railroad tracks again as it intersects with the parkway\\'s southeastward run on Harris Road ends just past the railroad crossing, where the highway turns northeast onto an unnamed road leading to a commercial and industrial area south of the hamlet of Katonah. After turning onto the highway, serves various businesses before the route ends at the southbound-only of the Saw Mill River Parkway. northbound feeds into the northbound direction of the parkway, while serves as the start of southbound. \\n Origins and local realignments \\n was assigned as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York. It initially began at the junction of Bedford and County House Roads in Tarrytown (both part of at the time) and followed Bedford Road northeast to (now at Jay Street in Katonah. was realigned to follow Sleepy Hollow Road instead, bypassing Tarrytown completely. The former routing of on Bedford Road to became a short extension of The route was also extended on its northern end in the mid-1970s after was moved onto a new highway that bypassed Katonah to the north. On 1980, ownership and maintenance of between Manville Road southwest of the Pleasantville village limits and Broadway within Pleasantville was transferred from the state of New York to Westchester County as part of a highway maintenance swap between the two levels of government. In return, ownership and maintenance of the entirety of Manville Road through Pleasantville was given to the state of New York from Westchester County. was rerouted to follow Manville Road while was extended one block north along former routing to intersect Manville Road. The remainder of former routing is now County from Manville Road to the Pleasantville village line, part of from View Street to Pleasantville Road, and from the Mount Pleasant village line to View Street and from Pleasantville Road to \\n Phelps Way \\n The portion of original routing between Tarrytown and Pleasantville passed through the center of Kykuit, the estate of the Rockefeller family, and was designed to handle 1,900 cars per day. The actual volume of traffic on the roadway was much higher as the actual average annual daily traffic reached upwards of 5,000 vehicles per day. As a result, the Rockefeller family looked into having the route realigned as early as 1932. The family suggested that a new highway be built along the northern end of the estate. In 1965, Rockefeller unveiled plans for the Potantico Expressway, a connector from the to-be-constructed Hudson River Expressway to the Taconic State Parkway. Some opposition to the idea arose on the grounds that the new highway would only benefit the Rockefeller estate and not the residents. Nonetheless, construction began on the Potantico Expressway (now known as Phelps Way) in 1969. When the highway was completed in it became part of a rerouted former alignment along Bedford Road became The Hudson River Expressway project was cancelled in 1971, and the western stub of the expressway now serves Phelps Hospital. \\n Katonah Bypass \\n The easternmost portion of in Katonah passed through a historic district containing several homes dating back to the late 19th century. Following the construction of nearby I-684 in 1968, this segment of became a truck route between the Interstate Highway and industrial areas along south of Katonah. While the Saw Mill River Parkway would have provided an alternate route to I-684 from commercial traffic was prohibited from using the highway. The trucks that used would shake the historic homes as it passed through the hamlet, causing small amounts of damage to the structures. A study analyzing the issue of truck traffic along in Katonah began in 1976 at the request of the town of Bedford. The study was completed in 1978, at which time the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) concluded that traffic would never become heavy enough along to bring about a need for a bypass. However, the state continued to keep abreast of the situation and eventually performed a second study in 1983. Unlike the first study, this one found traffic along the highway to be on the rise. As a result, the state began making plans to construct a bypass that would divert truck traffic away from Katonah. Over the next three years, NYSDOT proposed a total of nine different routings for the bypass. The route selected by the town of Bedford would begin at Harris Road and head north and east to the Saw Mill Parkway, which it would merge into. An exception would then be made to allow commercial traffic on the parkway between the Katonah Bypass and I-684. The routing of the highway, projected to cost $8.7 million (equivalent to in 2019), was approved in November 1987. In October 1990, NYSDOT accepted a low bid of $8.5 million (equivalent to in 2019) for the project, clearing the way for construction to begin on the bypass by the following month. The Katonah Bypass opened and became part of a realigned The portion of Bedford Road from Harris Road to is now maintained by the town of Bedford.\"b\\' \\n Mancilla \\n Mancilla Hidalgo (born October 7, 1993 in Santiago, Chile) is a Chilean footballer currently playing for Rangers of the Primera B de Chile.\\'b\" \\n Anne Mroczkowski \\n Anne Mroczkowski (born July 16, 1953) is a Canadian TV reporter and news anchor.

They can be closed or open-faced with no crust on top. \\n Dough \\n Pirogi are usually made from yeast-raised dough which distinguishes them from pies and pastries common in other cuisines. In former times, the dough for Russian pirogi was made predominantly of rye flour. Later it was mixed with wheat flour. Nowadays, mainly wheat flour is used. There are also variants made from shortcrust, flaky or puff pastry. In East-Slavic languages pirog is a generic term which denotes virtually any kind of pie, pastry, or cake. Karelian pastry (known as Karelian pirog in Russian), knish or charlotte are considered types of pirog in Eastern Europe. \\n Filling \\n The filling for pirogi may be sweet and contain quark or cottage cheese, fruits like apples, plums or various berries, as well as honey, nuts or poppy seeds. Savoury versions may consist of meat, fish, mushrooms, cabbage, rice, buckwheat groats or potato. In Ukrainian and Russian cuisines, pirogi (as well as their smaller versions called pirozhki) with a savoury filling are traditionally served as an accompaniment with clear borscht, broth or \\n Station (Niigata) \\n Lines \\n Station is served by the Tadami Line, and is 118.7 kilometers from terminus of the line at Aizu-Wakamatsu. \\n Station layout \\n The station consists of one ground-level side platform  serving a single bi-directional track.

With the privatization of Japanese National Railways (JNR) on 1 April 1987, the station came under the control of JR East.\\'b\" \\n Homeomorphism (graph theory) \\n In graph theory, two graphs  and  are homeomorphic if there is a graph isomorphism from some subdivision of  to some subdivision of .  If the edges of a graph are thought of as lines drawn from one vertex to another (as they are usually depicted in illustrations), then two graphs are homeomorphic to each other in the graph-theoretic sense precisely if they are homeomorphic in the sense in which the term is used in topology. \\n Barycentric Subdivisions \\n The barycentric subdivision subdivides each edge of the graph.  This is a special subdivision, as it always results in a bipartite graph.  This procedure can be repeated, so that the barycentric subdivision is the barycentric subdivision of the barycentric subdivision of the graph.  The second such subdivision is always a simple graph. \\n Example \\n In the following example, graph G and graph H are homeomorphic. G  H  If G\\' is the graph created by subdivision of the outer edges of G and H\\' is the graph created by subdivision of the inner edge of H, then G\\' and H\\' have a similar graph drawing: G\\', H\\'  Therefore, there exists an isomorphism between G\\' and H\\', meaning G and H are homeomorphic.\"b\\' \\n Allan Noble \\n Sir Allan Herbert Percy Noble, DSO, DSC (1908 17 November 1982) was an English naval commander, politician, and diplomat. \\n Career \\n Noble was the elder son of Admiral Sir Percy Noble.

The name Rato is a reference to Rato Monastery, aka Rato Dratsang, where Khyongla Rato studied. The current Khyongla Rinpoche was born in 1923, in a small village called Ophor, south of Chamdo in the Dagyab, Kham region of what was then Tibet. At the age of five, Norbu, as he was then known, was recognized as an incarnate lama, and on his 6th birthday he was taken to his labrang (a lama\\\\\\'s residence). He became a monk and studied at Rato Monastery, later moving to Drepung Monastery, where he received his Lharampa Geshe degree (equivalent to Doctor of Divinity), and finally to Gyuto Tantric University, where he served as abbot. In 1958, the 14th Dalai Lama was taking the examinations for his Lharampa Geshe degree. Khyongla Rato was asked to be one of two scholars who, during Monlam, would represent Rato Monastery as debating challengers in the Dalai Lama\\\\\\'s final examination at the Jokhang. Altogether there were eighty challengers from ten monasteries. As Khyongla Rato says in his autobiography, on page 233, when it was his turn to debate, \"For half an hour our thrilling interchange continued until the senior tutor, my good friend Ling Rinpoche, raised his hand and I returned to my place, exceedingly joyful and relieved.\" A photographic exhibition featuring Khyongla Rinpoche, Return to the Roof of the World, was held at the Leica Gallery in New York in 2011. It follows Nicholas Vreeland\\\\\\'s journey as a photographer while accompanying his teacher on his return to his birthplace in Dagyab, eastern Tibet, 50 years after he had left. \\n Teachers \\n Khyongla Rato Rinpoche studied with over 70 teachers, including Konchok Gyatso, Geshe Yeshe Loden, and from the age of 25 with Kyabje Ling Rinpoche, the senior tutor of the 14th Dalai Lama. While  Khyongla Rinpoche was still quite young, he attended a teaching from Pabongkhapa Nyingpo, and this served as a significant inspiration to him. \\n Publications \\n While first in India, at the request of the Dalai Lama, Khyongla Rato Rinpoche helped to write texts on the grammar, literature, history and religion of Tibet; these were used in the education of the families of Tibetan exiles. In the 1970s, as a result of urging from his students, Khyongla Rato wrote an autobiography, My Life and Lives; the book focuses primarily on his years in Tibet. Joseph Campbell, the American mythologist, edited the book and wrote the introduction. \\n The Tibet Center \\n In 1975, Khyongla Rato founded The Tibet Center in New York City. The center is also known as Kunkhyab Thardo Ling (translation: Land pervaded with Seekers of Liberation), a name that was given to the center by Ling Rinpoche. Khyongla Rato has taught at the Tibet Center for almost 40 years. Over the years many different teachers have taught at The Tibet Center, including not only high lamas from Tibetan Buddhism, but also Buddhists from the Chan, Theravadan and Zen traditions, as well as teachers from the Jain, Hindu and Christian religions, and scientists and philosophers. After its founding, Khyongla Rato was for many years the director of The Tibet Center. The current director is one of his students, Geshe Nicholas Vreeland, the subject of the documentary film Monk With A Camera. \\n Films \\n Despite having no prior acting experience, Khyongla Rato was asked to portray a monk in the filming of Little Buddha, directed by Bernardo Bertolucci and released in 1993. Khyongla Rato consulted the Dalai Lama, who told him he should go ahead and do this, so he ended up playing the role of the abbot of the Tibetan Buddhist monastery in Bhutan. Kyongla Rato Rinpoche has considerable screen time in the 2014 documentary Monk with a Camera, because he is the \"root guru\" of Nicholas Vreeland, the subject of the film.\\'b\" \\n Kike \\n Club career \\n Rodriguez started his career with a short spell with La Sporting.

Uses include filling, spacing, joining, or reinforcing members. Blocking is typically made from short off-cuts or defective, warped pieces of lumber.  Names for similar materials in other forms of English include dwang, nog, noggin, and nogging. The term Blocking is also sometimes used by people in construction to refer to discontinuous shims or spacers. \\n Uses \\n Some blocking is used structurally like cross bracing between joists in a subfloor to prevent buckling and stiffen the floor. This use is also called block bridging, solid bridging, and solid strutting. Fire-blocking is a firestop. Blocks are spacers between studs such as where an interior wall attaches an exterior wall and for framing corners such as a \"three-stud corner with blocking\". Blocking is used for panel edge supports such as sheets of drywall or plywood also called back blocking Blocking, often called backing or sometimes grounds, also refers to pieces of wood or other material that run between wall studs in order to provide support and attachment sites for mounted hardware or trim such as cabinets, shelving, handrails, vanity tops without a cabinet underneath, bathroom towel bars, mouldings etc. Properly installed blocking is easier to find and use for attaching wall hardware than studs alone. Once drywall, or any other material, covers the wall it can be difficult to find 2x4 studs for attachment, and the position of nails and screws must be adjusted to stud location. Thus, if blocking is installed at a uniform and predetermined height, attachment sites can be found without using a stud finder, and the blocking can be utilized anywhere along a wall at that height. This is particularly useful for installing upper cabinets in kitchens or bathrooms as they tend to be fairly heavy and finding appropriate studs for installation can be difficult.\\'b\\' \\n Tranquil Creek Provincial Park \\n Tranquil Creek Provincial Park is a provincial park in British Columbia, Canada, located at the head of the Kennedy River, east of the head of Bedwell Sound on Vancouver Island.\\'b\\' \\n Nat (Muslim) \\n History and origin \\n The Muslim Nat are a semi-nomadic community, traditionally associated rope dancing, juggling, fortune telling and begging. They are found mainly in the districts of Madhubani, Darbhanga, Samastipur and Patna. They speak Urdu. \\n Present circumstances \\n The Muslim Nat are mainly cattle dealers, while a small number are involved in begging. They are one of the most marginalized Muslim communities in Bihar. Almost all the Nat are landless. A small number of Nat have now settled down and are cultivators. The Nat are strictly endogamous, and generally live in isolation from other Muslim communities in their neighbourhoods. Although they are Sunni Muslims, they incorporate many folk beliefs. In Uttar Pradesh, the Nat are said to have come originally from Chittaur in Rajasthan. They are found mainly in the districts of Varanasi, Allahabad, Barabanki and Jaunpur. The Nat speak Urdu and Hindi and converted to Islam during the rule of the Nawabs of Awadh, about two hundred years ago. The Muslim Nat consist of number of sub-groups, the main ones being the Aman, Goleri, Mahawat, Rari, Siarmaroa and Turkata. Many Nat are still involved with fortune telling and live a semi-nomadic lifestyle. Most Nat are now landless agricultural labourers, and are in depressed economic circumstances. The Nat are Sunni Muslims, but incorporate many folk beliefs. In Haryana, they are found mainly in the districts of Faridabad, Gurgaon and Rohtak. They speak Haryanvi, and understand Hindi. Little is known about the circumstances of their conversion to Islam. Historically, the community in Haryana were rope dancers, jugglers and acrobats. The Nat consist of a number of exogamous clans, the main ones being the Dagariya, Sansebar, Baraike, Khoyareke, Paharike, Nangariye, Dhadhasiya, Palike, Jirmichya, Dangiya, Kotiya, Shirkarake, Dilwati, Occhluke, Rashidiya, and Badanke. The Nat are no longer involved in their traditional occupation, and are now largely landless agriculture workers, migrating to different places in search of employment. They are nominally Sunni, but practice many folk beliefs.\\'b\\' \\n 101st Division (Imperial Japanese Army) \\n Background \\n The February 26 Incident in 1936 have exposed how much the 1st division was politicized and become dangerous to the regime itself. Therefore, to dispose of a disloyal Tokyo garrison, the 1st division was sent to Soviet border. As new troops were urgently needed after the Second Sino-Japanese War flared up in July 1937, the new division in Tokyo was raised anyway, but with much lower stature compared to normal line-of-battle divisions. \\n Action \\n The division was ordered to join Battle of Shanghai 11 September 1937 as part of the Shanghai Expeditionary Army. In December 1937, the division has also participated in the Battle of Nanking. At that period, the division have crossed Yangtze River and captured Zhenjiang. From March 1938, the 101st division has fought in the Battle of Xuzhou. 4 July 1938, the 101st division was incorporated into 11th army and proceed to participate in Battle of Wuhan until October 1938, in particular suffering heavy losses in the Battle of Wanjialing in September 1938. It also took part in the Battle of Nanchang in March - May 1939 and Battle of Changsha (1939) in October 1939. The 101st division has started demobilization 7 November 1939, and was dissolved 25 February 1940.\\'b\\' \\n Wine Road of the Samurai \\n Plot summary \\n This documentary is about a group of samurai sent by the Japanese government to France at the end of the Edo period. At the time, all the ports of Japan were closed, cutting it off from the rest of the world. The samurai were sent to help solve diplomatic problems between Japan and Europe on December 29, 1863. They were welcomed by every government and head of state they visited, including Napoleon III, in France. They were also photographed standing in front of Sphinx, in Egypt. The samurai brought back lots of products from their trip, including a book on wine production. They ended their expedition earlier than expected due to the need to report home about the astonishing technology in modernized countries.\\'b\\' \\n Crassispira obliquata \\n Distribution \\n Fossils have been found in Eocene strata in the Paris Basin, France.\\'b\\' \\n Oleg Anofriyev \\n Biography \\n Oleg Andreyevich Anofriyev was born in Gelendzhik on July 20, 1930 in the family of a doctor, head of medical furniture at the GPP-1, Andrei Sergeevich Anofriev and housewife Maria Gavrilovna Anofriyeva and was their third son, he had two older brothers, Sergei and Vladimir.

During the same period, Italian film-director Maurizio Ponzi sent to Dolcenera the screenplay from the film Ci vediamo a casa, which is based upon a similar story, asking her to write a song for its soundtrack. The track later became the main song from the film, scheduled to be released in Italy in April 2012. The lyrics of the song are focused on the conditions of young generations in Italy during the economic crisis which began in 2008, describing the difficulties that a couple has to face while trying to get a place to live in together. According to Dolcenera, a home also represents the symbol of a shelter, an opportunity to build a life together with the loved man or woman. Cultural and economic problems are described by means of a lovestory. \\n Sanremo Music Festival \\n On 15 January 2012, during the TV programme L\\\\\\'arena, Gianni Morandi announced the complete list of songs competing in the \"Big Artists\" section of the Sanremo Music Festival 2012, also including Dolcenera\\\\\\'s \"Ci vediamo a casa\". Dolcenera performed the song for the first time on 14 February 2012, when she opened the competition during the first night of the festival. Following a technical problem in the voting process, all the songs were admitted to the second night of the show. The song was performed again the following day, being admitted to the semi-final, which was held on 17 February 2012. During the fourth night, Dolcenera sang the track in a duet with Max gaining access to the final, during which she placed sixth in the overall ranking. During all Dolcenera\\\\\\'s performances, the Sanremo Festival Orchestra was conducted by Fabio Gurian. \\n Music video \\n The music video for the song was directed by Valentina Be.  It in addition features scenes from the film of the same title, directed by Maurizio Ponzi, that revolves around the problem of finding a home in which to live together by three very different couples. In fact without any taboo and with much courage especially in Italy where the homosexuality is not widely accepted; the movie also recounts the relationship of a couple formed by the two gay cops interpreted by the young and beautiful Nicolas Vaporidis and Primo Reggiani.  The other two copies are interpreted by Italian actors Ambra Angiolini, Edoardo Leo, Giuliana De Sio, Myriam Catania and Giulio Forges Davanzati.\\'b\\' \\n Dave Logan (writer) \\n Career \\n Logan gained a Ph.D. in Organizational Communication from the Annenberg School at University of Southern California (USC).

Milne was born in Aberdeen, and studied at the University of Aberdeen and the Free Church College. He was ordained in 1868 as a missionary under the Presbyterian Synod of Otago and Southland, and arrived in Nguna in 1870. By 1896 the entire island was (at least nominally) Christian. Milne served in the New Hebrides for more than fifty years. Milne encouraged the production of arrowroot as a means of paying for the printing of religious books in the local language. Along with Daniel Macdonald and John W. Mackenzie, Milne translated the Old Testament into Efatese. He and Macdonald were involved in a feud that lasted for more than fifteen years, which started with a disagreement over how to translate the word \"God\" in the local language.\\'b\\' \\n Motuloa (south of Nukufetau) \\n Motuloa is an islet on the east side of Nukufetau atoll, Tuvalu.\\'b\\' \\n goat \\n The Goat (Swedish: is a traditional Christmas display erected annually at Slottstorget (Castle Square) in central Sweden. It is a giant version of a traditional Swedish Yule Goat figure made of straw. It is erected each year at the beginning of Advent over a period of two days by local community groups, and has become famous for being destroyed in arson attacks during December. Despite security measures and the nearby presence of a fire station, the goat has been burned to the ground most years since its first appearance in 1966. As of December 2017, the goat has been damaged 37 times. Since 1986 two Yule Goats have been built in the Goat by the Southern Merchants and the Yule Goat built by the Natural Science Club of the School of Vasa. \\n History \\n The Goat is erected every year on the first day of Advent, which according to Western Christian tradition is in late November or early December, depending on the calendar year. In 1966, an advertising consultant, Stig (1927-2018), came up with the idea of making a giant version of the traditional Swedish Yule Goat and placing it in the square. The design of the first goat was assigned to the then chief of the fire department, brother The construction of the goat was carried out by the fire department, and they erected the goat each year from 1966 to 1970 and from 1986 to 2002. The first goat was financed by Harry On 1 December 1966, a 13-metre tall, 7-metre long, 3-tonne goat was erected in the square. On New Year\\\\\\'s Eve, the goat was burnt down, and the perpetrator was found and convicted of vandalism. The goat was insured, and got all of his money back. A group of businessmen known as the Southern Merchants financed the building of the goat in subsequent years. In 1971, the Southern Merchants stopped building the goats. The Natural Science Club (Naturvetenskapliga of the School of Vasa (Vasaskolan) began building the structure. Their goat was around 2 metres Due to the positive reaction their Yule Goat received that year, they built another one the following year and from then on. The Southern Merchants began building their own goats again in 1986. The cost for the 1966 goat was SEK 10,000. The price tag for constructing the goat in 2005 was around 100,000 Swedish kronor. The city pays one-third of the cost while the Southern Merchants pay the remaining sum. Since 2003 the construction of the goat has been undertaken by a group of unemployed people known as ALU workers. The display has become notable for being a recurring target for vandalism by arson, and has been destroyed many times since the first goat was erected in 1966. Because the fire station is close to the location of the goat, most of the time the fire can be extinguished before the wooden skeleton is severely damaged. If the goat is burned down before December 13th, the feast day of Saint Lucia, the goat is rebuilt. The skeleton is then treated and repaired, and the goat reconstructed over it, using straw which the Goat Committee has pre-ordered. As of 2005, four people have been caught or convicted for vandalizing the goat. In 2001, the goat was burned down by a 51-year-old visitor from Cleveland, Ohio in the United States, who spent 18 days in jail and was subsequently convicted and ordered to pay 100,000 Swedish kronor in damages. The court confiscated his cigarette lighter with the argument that he clearly was not able to handle it. He stated in court that he was no \"goat burner\", and believed that he was taking part in a completely legal goat-burning tradition. After he was released from jail he returned to the US without paying his fine. In 1996, the Southern Merchants introduced camera surveillance to monitor the goat 24 hours a day. On 27 November 2004 the Goat\\\\\\'s homepage was hacked into and one of the two official webcams changed. One year, while security guards were posted around the goat in order to prevent further vandalism, the temperature dropped far below zero. As the guards ducked into a nearby restaurant to escape the cold, the vandals struck. During the weekend of December 2005 a series of attacks on public Yule Goats across Sweden were carried out; The Goat was burnt on 3 December. The Visby goat on Gotland burned down, the Yule Goat in was torched, and there was an attack on a goat located in Lycksele,  The Christmas season of 2006 marked the 40th anniversary of the Goat, and, on Sunday 3 December, the city held a large celebration in honor of the goat. The Goat Committee fireproofed the goat with \"Fiber ProTector Fireproof\", a fireproofing substance that is used in airplanes. In earlier years when the goat had been fireproofed, the dew had made the liquid drip off the goat. To prevent this from happening in 2006, \"Fireproof ProTechtor Solvent Base\" was applied to the goat. Despite their efforts, the goat has been destroyed a total of 36 times, including the most recent incident, on 27 November 2016, when an arsonist equipped with petrol burned it down, just hours after its inauguration. \\n Natural Science Club\\\\\\'s Yule Goat \\n Since 1986 there have been two Yule Goats built in the Goat by the Southern Merchants and the Yule Goat built by the Natural Science Club of the School of Vasa. Until 1985 the Southern Merchants held the world record for the largest Yule Goat, but over the years the Natural Science Club\\\\\\'s goat increased in size, and in 1985 their Yule Goat made it into the Guinness Book of Records with an official height of 12.5 metres The creator of the original 1966 goat, Stig thought that the Natural Science Club\\\\\\'s goat had unfairly won the title of the largest Yule Goat because the goat was not as attractive as the Southern Merchants\\\\\\' goat and the neck was excessively long. The next year there was a Goat war: the Southern Merchants understood the publicity value, and erected a huge goat, the Natural Science Club erected a smaller one in protest. The Southern Merchants had intended that their huge goat would reclaim the world record, but the measurement of the goat showed it fell short. Over the following seven years there were no further attempts on the world record, but there was some hostility between the Natural Science Club and the Southern Merchants, evidenced by the fact that the Natural Science Club put up a sign near their goat wishing a Merry Christmas to everyone, except the Southern Merchants. In 1993 the Southern Merchants again announced that they were going to attempt the world record. The goat stood 10.5 metres when completed. The Natural Science Club\\\\\\'s Yule Goat that year measured 14.9 metres which earned them another place in the Guinness Book of Records.\\'b\\' \\n Luke Adams (footballer) \\n Career \\n In 2012, Adams joined the English club Derby County F.C. on a one-year contract. In 2013, Adams signed a one-year contract with Wellington Phoenix. In May 2014, Adams was called into the All Whites squad for a 30 May friendly in Auckland against South Africa by interim coach Neil Emblen. In September 2014, Adams returned to Waitakere United. In January 2015, Adams signed with Australian football club South Melbourne FC. In December 2017, Adams signed with Ljungskile SK in Division 1 the Swedish third tier.

He made his debut for the senior New Zealand national football team in a 2016 OFC Nations Cup win over Fiji. In June 2016, Adams scored the winner in a 1-0 win over the Solomon Islands. The match was a World Cup qualifier.\\'b\" \\n Kerzhenets Nature Reserve \\n Topography \\n The reserve is roughly across, and north of the Volga as it flows due east at this point. The north and west half of the reserve are forested, and the south and east are riverine wetlands.  80% of the territory is in the lowlands of the Kerzhenets river basin.  The bedrock is Permian clay, marl and limestone overlain by 5 to 30 meters of alluvial sediments.  The banks of the tributaries of the Kerzhenets are marked by outcrops of carbonate rocks. \\n Climate and Ecoregion \\n Kerzhinski is located in the Scandinavian and Russian taiga ecoregion.  This is situated in Northern Europe between tundra in the north and temperate mixed forests in the south.  It is covers parts of Norway, Sweden, Finland and the northern part of European Russia, being the largest ecoregion in Europe.  Coniferous forests dominated by Pinus sylvestris (in drier locations), often with an understory of Juniperus communis, Picea abies and Picea obovata and a significant admixture of Betula pubescens and Betula pendula. Larix sibirica is characteristic of the eastern part of the ecoregion. The climate of Kerzhinski is Humid continental climate, cool summer climate classification (Dfb)). This climate is characterized by large swings in temperature, both diurnally and seasonally, with mild summers and cold, snowy winters. The average January temperature is -12 C, July is 19 C.  Annual precipitation averages  Winds in the summer are from the northwest, but from the south and west the remainder of the year. \\n Flora and fauna \\n The landscape displays features of Eastern European mixed forest, particularly peat bogs, pine forests (60% of the territory) and alder-birch forests (35% of the reserve) in the lower wetter regions, with associated plants and animals.  The remainder of the landscape is swamp and transitional mire.  The area was subject to extensive tree loss (to logging and fires, particularly a disastrous fire in 1972 that killed 20% of the trees), so the stands are mostly middle-aged or younger.  A recent study of the reserve recorded 103 species of algae, 283 of mushrooms, 205 of lichens, 160 of bryophytes and 593 species of vascular plants. Because the reserve is in a transitional zone on the edges of three regions - taiga, broadleaf forest, and steppe - it has animals that are representative of each.   Taiga species include caribou, wolverine and squirrel.  Broadleaf forests to the west contribute martens, minks, and wood mice. Steppe species include voles, hedgehogs, and field mice. Throughout are the larger mammals of the woods: wolf, fox, badger, stoat, weasel, and bear.  Part of the work of the reserve is experimenting with the re-introduction and recovery of species that have been lost to the territory.  Current reintroduction efforts are focused on the muskrat, the Willow ptarmigan, and the forest reindeer. \\n Ecotourism \\n As a strict nature reserve, the Kerzhenski Reserve is mostly closed to the general public, although scientists and those with \\'environmental education\\' purposes can make arrangements with park management for visits. There are three main \\'ecotourist\\' routes that have been developed for tourists: a floodplain tour, a swamp tour, and a forest tour. The reserve has also opened a visitor center.  The main office is in the town of Rustai.\"b\" \\n Elvis Luciano \\n Professional career \\n Luciano was signed as an international free agent on October 1, 2016, by the Arizona Diamondbacks. He split this debut season of 2017 between the Rookie-level Dominican Summer League Diamondbacks and AZL Diamondbacks, and the Rookie Advanced Missoula Osprey. He posted a combined record with a 2.84 ERA in innings over 16 games (8 starts). Luciano opened the 2018 season in extended spring training. On June 6, 2018, the Arizona Diamondbacks traded Luciano and Gabe Speier to the Kansas City Royals for Jon Jay. He played for the Rookie Advanced Idaho Falls Chukars and Burlington Royals in 2018, combining to go with a 3.90 ERA in 134 innings over 26 games (24 starts).   The Blue Jays selected Luciano from the Royals organization in the 2018 Rule 5 draft. He was eligible because his first professional contract had been voided due to a medical issue. \\n Toronto Blue Jays \\n Luciano made the Blue Jays\\' 2019 Opening Day roster, becoming the first active major league player born in the 2000s. He made his major league debut on March 31, throwing scoreless innings against the Detroit Tigers, becoming the youngest ever Blue Jay pitcher.   (The youngest-ever Blue Jays player remains catcher Brian Milner, who at the age of 18 played two games in 1978.)   On April 28, 2019, Luciano earned his first major league win after pitching the bottom third of the 11th inning before the Blue Jays walked off the Oakland Athletics On June 12, 2019, Luciano went on the 10-day injured list due to a right elbow sprain. On June 17, he was transferred to the 60-day injured list. He was activated from the injured list on September 12.\"b\" \\n 2017 Missouri Valley Conference Men\\'s Soccer Tournament \\n Background \\n The 2017 Missouri Valley Conference Men\\'s Soccer Tournament is the culmination of the regular season. The regular season conference matches determine the seeding in the tournament, which determines the conference\\'s automatic berth into the NCAA Tournament. All teams in the Missouri Valley Conference, or MVC, play each other once during the season. Teams play certain teams at home during even number years, and then will play those teams on the road during odd number years. Teams are awarded three points for a win, a point for a draw and no points for a loss. In the event that teams are tied on points, the first tiebreaker is head-to-head record. If that tiebreaker is tied, goal differential is applied, followed by goals scored, then away goals, then RPI. Missouri State won the regular season with a 5-2-1 record.\"b\" \\n Bertie County, North Carolina \\n History \\n The county was formed as Bertie Precinct in 1722 from the part of Chowan Precinct of Albemarle County lying west of the Chowan River. It was named for James Bertie, his brother Henry Bertie, or perhaps both, each having been one of the Lords Proprietors of Carolina. In 1729 parts of Bertie Precinct, Chowan Precinct, Currituck Precinct, and Pasquotank Precinct of Albemarle County were combined to form Tyrrell Precinct. With the abolition of Albemarle County in 1739, all of its constituent precincts became separate counties. As population of settlers increased, in 1741 parts of Bertie County were organized as Edgecombe County and Northampton County. Finally, in 1759 parts of Bertie, Chowan, and Northampton counties were combined to form Hertford County. Bertie\\'s boundaries have remained the same since then. This mostly rural county depended on the agricultural economy well into the 20th century. In the colonial and antebellum eras, tobacco and cotton were the chief commodity crops, worked by enslaved African Americans. After the Civil War, agriculture continued to be important to the county. In the 21st century, developers have referred to it as being within the Inner Banks region, which is increasingly attracting retirees and buyers of second homes, because of its beaches and lovely landscapes. \\n Geography \\n According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of 741 square miles of which 699 square miles is land and 42 square miles (5.7%) is water.\"b\\' \\n 1922 Italian general strike \\n The Italian general strike of October 1922 was a general strike against Benito Mussolini\\\\\\'s power-grab with the March on Rome. It was led by socialists and ended in defeat for the workers.  Mussolini famously referred to this as the \"Caporetto of Italian Socialism\". Rudolph Rocker, an active Anarcho-Syndicalist of this period, described the event in his book: \"When in 1922 the general strike against Fascism broke out, the democratic government armed the Fascist hordes and throttled this last attempt at the defence of freedom and right. But Italian democracy had dug its own grave. It thought it could use Mussolini as a tool against the workers, but thus it became its own grave-digger.\"\\'b\\' \\n Motor Barnaul \\n History \\n The club was founded in 1959 as the successor club to Spartak Barnaul, which had been founded in 1954. In Soviet times, Barnaul participated in various lower-level leagues. In the season the club participated in the second-level league organized by the Ice Hockey Federation of Russia. From 1999-2006, the club participated in the second-level Russian league, the Vysshaya Liga. The club was dissolved due to financial problems in 2006. It was replaced by Altai Barnaul, which currently competes in the third-level Russian league, the Pervaya Liga.\\'b\\' \\n Critical Path (book) \\n Overview \\n The following is a list of the main claims and opinions presented in the book, reported without discussion or criticism. \\n Part One \\n The first part of the book explains the history and present state of the global economy. \\n Chapter 1 - Speculative Prehistory of Humanity \\n Human life began in the atolls of the South Pacific, where the average sea temperature is closest to that of the human body Rather than evolving from simpler organisms, humanity was of extraterrestrial origin and other organisms evolved from us From this base, humanity developed boat-building in Southeast Asia and colonised the rest of the planet There is evidence that the Bronze Age began in Southeast Asia Fuller\\\\\\'s Dymaxion World Map is used to show the distribution of humanity over the Earth\\\\\\'s surface. Over half the population lives in the regions watered by the Himalayan glaciers \\n Chapter 2 - Humans in Universe \\n Our knowledge of the spherical shape of the Earth is central to our understanding of ecology This knowledge probably originated in prehistoric times, was certainly known to the Ancient Greeks, but was then suppressed for centuries by organised religion because it was incompatible with the official story of a Heaven above and a Hell below There has been an evolution of religious ideas from those of the Egyptian pyramid-builders, whose ambition was to deliver a single individual, the pharaoh, into the afterlife, to the modern belief that everybody has a right to enjoy life on Earth \\n Chapter 3 - Legally Piggily \\n Fire is the Sun unwinding from the tree\\\\\\'s log. p.62 Human history has been shaped by the continual growth and success of greed. City-states were the first institutions to make organised use of extortion This was then followed by the growth of international trade, which appropriates the wealth of the planet for its own ends. Corruption in the form of \"lawyer-capitalism\" has led the U.S.A. to become effectively bankrupt with the common people obliged to fund the profitmaking activity of corporations. Eventually the U.S. taxpayers will be asked to make \"free-of-risk\" bail-outs of \"private\" enterprises p.87 \\n Part Two \\n The second part of the book explains Fuller\\\\\\'s getting a perspective. \\n Chapter 4 - Self-Disciplines of Buckminster Fuller \\n Fuller\\\\\\'s diary, the \"Chronofile\", is intended to show how much a single human being with little money can do to influence world affairs The mechanical principle of precession is used as a metaphor for the ability of a person to influence the world by applying pressure in an unconventional direction Fuller\\\\\\'s religious beliefs are explained Fuller observed that when he did things for the benefit of others, it had a positive effect on his life, but when he did things merely for his personal benefit, the outcome was negative. This eventually led him to the proposition that if he dedicated his life to the betterment of humanity, he would achieve the greatest positive outcome. So he decided to live his entire life as an experiment to prove or disprove this proposition. He writes I assumed that nature would \"evaluate\" my work as I went along. If I was doing what nature wanted done, and if I was doing it in promising ways, permitted by nature\\\\\\'s principles, I would find my work being economically vice versa, in which latter negative case I must quickly cease doing what I had been doing and seek logically alternative courses until I found the new course that nature signified her approval of by providing for its physical support. Wherefore, I concluded that I would be informed by nature if I proceeded in the following manner: (A) committed myself, my wife, and our infant daughter directly to the design, production, and demonstration of artifact accommodation of the most evident but as-yet-unattended-to human-environment-advantaging physical evolutionary tasks, and (B) paid no attention to \"earning a living\" in humanity\\\\\\'s established economic system, yet (C) found my family\\\\\\'s and my own life\\\\\\'s needs being unsolicitedly provided for by seemingly pure happenstance and always only \"in the nick of time,\" and (D) being provided for \"only coincidentally,\" yet found (E) that this only \"coincidentally,\" unbudgetable, yet realistic support persisted, and did so (F) only so long as I continued spontaneously to commit myself unreservedly to the task of developing relevant artifacts, and if I (G) never tried to persuade humanity to alter its customs and viewpoints and never asked anyone to listen to me and spoke informatively to others only when they asked me so to do, and if I (H) never undertook competitively to produce artifacts others were developing, and attended only to that which no others attended then I could tentatively conclude that my two assumptions were valid: (1) that nature might economically sustain human activity that served directly in the \"mainstream\" realization of essential cosmic regeneration, which had hitherto been accomplished only through seeming \"right-angled\" side effects of the chromosomically focused biological creatures; and (2) that the generalized physical law of precessional behaviors does govern socioeconomic behaviors as do also the generalized laws of acceleration and ephemeralization. \\n Chapter 5 - The Geoscope \\n The Geoscope is a large-scale, animated globe of the Earth intended to help people visualise the spatial and temporal patterns of human activity, either in real time or replayed at different speeds. If the human mind is presented with all of this information at once, it should be able to use its visual pattern-detecting abilities to solve complex problems such as weather-forecasting, resource conflicts, and wars Data for the Geoscope can come from the world maps produced by the USA, using radio triangulation, during and after World War II Geodesic domes will be built to enclose entire cities Afghanistan was the heartland of the Cold War world, as it gave the USSR the potential of a route through Iran to the Indian Ocean \\n Chapter 6 - World Game \\n The World Game is a simulation of global economic activity. Computers can be used to calculate the optimal answer to any economic, technological or social question.

The original township of Maryborough was situated, not in its current place, but on the north of the Mary River, after wharves were established in 1847-8 providing transport for wool from sheep stations on the Burnett River. In 1850 surveyor Hugh Roland Labatt arrived in Maryborough with instructions to \"examine the River Mary ... to suggest ...t he best site or sites for the laying out of the town, having regard to the convenience of shipping on one hand and internal communication on the other ... also ... point out the spots desirable as reserves for public building, church, quay and for places for public recreation.\" The site recommended by Labatt was not where settlement was established but further east and from the early 1850s this is where the growing town developed. During the 1860s an 1870s, Maryborough flourished as the principal port of Gympie where gold was discovered in 1867. Andrew Heron Wilson arrived in Maryborough in about 1866 and established the Maryborough Sawmills, where he worked for many years before joining in partnership R Hart and J Bartholemew, and constructing a larger sawmill for Wilson, Hart and Co., as the partnership was known, in 1881. He retired from milling after only two years at his new mill. Wilson was a large investor in Gympie gold mining and was a director of the Monkland South Glanmire Company and also of the Maryborough Building Society. He was a member of the Queensland Legislative Council from 19 September 1883 until his death on 29 August 1906. In about 1882 Wilson acquired the property on which he constructed his residence, a large timber house, known as Doon Villa overlooking the Mary River. This was an impressive house and an early history of Maryborough considers it one of the residential jewels of Maryborough, and indeed of Queensland. Wilson planned an impressive garden around the house. He constructed a bowling green for use by a lawn bowls club at his home, the oldest in Queensland. In 1889 Wilson and his wife went on an extended holiday, first to England and then to New Zealand, where they visited Mrs Wilson\\\\\\'s sister, Margaret Blair and her children. Margaret Blair\\\\\\'s husband, Robert, died on 18 February 1893 and his wife and children left New Zealand and went to live with the Wilsons at Doon Villa in Maryborough. Wilson is thought to have managed the construction of a new house, called Blairholme, for his wife\\\\\\'s sister and her four children. Wilson purchased the land, being section 2 on Allotment 147, adjacent to Doon Villa\\\\\\'s Sections 3 and 4, on which Blairholme was built in 1891 and the house is thought to have been built sometime after Mrs Blair\\\\\\'s arrival in 1893. Wilson\\\\\\'s involvement with the timber and iron industries in Maryborough may explain the absence of tender notices for the construction of the house, which has made identification of an architect difficult. It is suggested that the architect of Blairholme was from Rockhampton. By 1895 the house was completed and the Blair family were in residence. The death of Andrew Wilson on 29 August 1906 resulted in his land being transferred to Queensland Trustees Limited as a condition of his will, although it appears that the Blair family remained in the house until 1935 when the allotments were subdivided and sold. Hugh Keys bought the property on which Blairholme stood and, two years later, on 8 March 1937, this property was transferred to James Richard Lambert Hyne, a member of another prominent local timber milling family company. The Hyne family were descendant from Richard Matthews Hyne who arrived in Maryborough and established himself as the publican of the Royal Hotel in about 1873. Hyne realised that Maryborough was an emerging municipality as the port of the flourishing Wide Bay-Burnett region and Gympie goldfields. He became interested in establishing institutions in the town and helped improved health, education, welfare and recreational facilities in the area. Hyne was mayor of Maryborough for a year in 1878. The Hyne family have a long interest in the local timber milling industry and their family company continues to this day. The Hyne family had a family home in Lennox Street called Ilfracombe and when they bought Blairholme the name was transferred from this earlier residence. On the death of his father the property was transferred to Warren Henry Hyne who retains the house. In 2012 ownership was transferred to Rod and Sue Grieves who are now reside there with their family. The building has been altered over its life with rear sections removed and replaced. Internally, many changes have been made including extending the kitchen area both into the space of the verandah and into an extension of the house. \\n Description \\n Ilfracombe is a large one-storeyed timber constructed overlooking, to the east, a reach of the Mary River. Access to the house is via a laneway from the northern end of Lennox Street, with the building concealed from the street. Surrounding the house is a large garden which includes several established trees and plantings. The house is a timber framed building clad with horizontal timber weatherboards. The corrugated iron roof of the building, which incorporates an attic, is quite complex, reflecting the complexity of the internal planning. The roof scape comprises a number of asymmetrically arranged and variously sized gabled and hipped sections, with a steeply pitched mansard roof over the attic, which is surmounted with a decorative cast iron balustrade, with projecting finials from the corners. Surmounting the gabled ends are similar cast iron finials. The house is lined on three sides by bull-nosed verandahs although some of these have been infilled. Generally the building has high quality joinery and craftsmanship; several projecting bay windows are filled with etched and coloured glass panels and the external joinery is of fine quality. Internally the building generally has timber boarded floors, walls and ceilings. Occasionally the size or orientation of timber boarding varies indicating that much of the house may have been papered or otherwise lined internally when constructed. The interior is arranged around a central vestibule from which hallways lead to the principal entrance to the south and to the kitchen on the west. Many original features remain intact, including a fine anaglypta lined vaulted ceiling in the drawing room; internal doors and other joinery; a fine fireplace with painted tiles, despite many internal alterations. \\n Heritage listing \\n Ilfracombe was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland\\\\\\'s history. Ilfracombe was constructed between 1893 and 1895 as the residence Margaret Blair, who was the sister-in-law of Andrew Heron Wilson on whose land the house was built, adjacent to his own residence. The house demonstrates the growth of Maryborough in the late nineteenth century and, in particular, this section of Maryborough which developed as a residential area for large timber homes overlooking a reach of the Mary River. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The building is a fine and characteristic example of a large timber home built in Queensland in the late nineteenth century. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The building is a fine and characteristic example of a large timber home built in Queensland in the late nineteenth century. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland\\\\\\'s history. The building is associated with prominent Maryborough families, the Wilsons and the Hynes.\\'b\\' \\n Vic Tayback \\n Life and career \\n Tayback was born in Brooklyn, New York City, New York, the son of Helen Hanood) and Najeeb James Tayback. His parents were immigrants from Aleppo, Syria. Tayback moved with his family to Burbank, California, during his teenage years and attended Burbank High School. He ended up living in the area for the rest of his life, eventually moving to nearby Glendale, California, where he resided until his death. A lifetime member of the Actors Studio, Tayback was a familiar face on television in the 1960s and 1970s, appearing on numerous series as a character actor. Two notable appearances were in the \"Et tu, Archie?\" fourth-season episode of All in the Family as Archie\\\\\\'s old friend, Joe Tucker, and as the 1920s-style gangster-boss Jojo Krako in the Star Trek episode \"A Piece of the Action\". Tayback\\\\\\'s most famous role was diner owner Mel Sharples in both the film Alice Doesn\\\\\\'t Live Here Anymore (1974) and the television series Alice Although Alfred Lutter reprised his role as Alice\\\\\\'s son Tommy in the pilot episode of the television series (he was replaced by Philip McKeon when the series began), Vic Tayback was the only actor in the original film to reprise his role for the rest of the series. Tayback received one Primetime Emmy Award nomination in 1978 and three Golden Globe Award nominations (winning two) from 1980 to 1982 for the role. \\n Death \\n Tayback died of a heart attack in 1990 and was interred at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Los Angeles. Tayback was survived by his wife Sheila, whom he married in 1962. They had one son, Christopher Tayback, who briefly acted before attending law school.\\'b\\' \\n Metro Exodus \\n Gameplay \\n Metro Exodus is a first-person shooter game with survival horror and stealth elements. Set in the post-apocalyptic wasteland of the former Russian Federation, the player must cope with the new hazards and engage in combat against mutated creatures as well as hostile humans. The player wields an arsenal of hand-made weaponry which can be customised through scavenging materials and a crafting system. The game features a mixture of linear levels and sandbox environments. It also includes a dynamic weather system, a day-night cycle, and environments that change along with the seasons as the story progresses. It is set over the course of one whole in-game year. \\n Setting \\n Metro Exodus is set after the events of Metro: Last Light, on a post-apocalyptic Earth that has been devastated by a nuclear war. The game continues the story from Metro: Last Light\\\\\\'s \"Redemption\" ending. Similar to the previous two entries, the player assumes the role of Artyom, who flees the Moscow Metro and sets off on a continent-spanning journey with his allies to the far east, on a locomotive called the \"Aurora\". The story takes place over the course of one year, starting with a harsh nuclear winter in the Metro. Another major character, returning from the previous game and the book Metro 2035, is Anna - who is now Artyom\\\\\\'s wife. Miller, Anna\\\\\\'s father and leader of the Spartan Order, also returns from previous games and novels. \\n Plot \\n After the attack on D6, Artyom becomes disillusioned with the constant infighting and corruption within the Metro and leaves the Spartan Order. He soon becomes obsessed with proving that other human survivors exist outside of Moscow and makes numerous dangerous expeditions to the surface, much to Anna\\\\\\'s concern and Miller\\\\\\'s frustration. However, on one such expedition with Anna, they witness a working train running on the surface. Before they can follow it, they are captured by Hansa soldiers along with a couple of people who claim to be from outside of Moscow. The Hansa soldiers execute the other prisoners and Artyom is shot and left for dead. Surviving the gunshot, Artyom follows the soldiers to their base to rescue Anna, and in the process inadvertently destroys a signal jammer that was blocking all communications going in and out of Moscow. Radio transmissions from all over the world begin to be picked up, and Artyom and Anna realise humanity has not gone extinct. They escape by stealing one of Hansa\\\\\\'s trains with the aid of a defected Hansa train engineer called Yermak. As the train leaves, the Spartan Order moves in to retake it and are shocked and confused at Artyom and Anna\\\\\\'s presence. Knowing that Hansa will have all of them put to death for knowing the truth, Miller concludes that the Spartans\\\\\\' best chance of survival is to flee Moscow. Once outside the city, he reveals to the others that while many of Russia\\\\\\'s cities were bombed, the war did not end and NATO proceeded to occupy what was left of the nation. To prevent more bombs from being dropped on Moscow, the Russian leadership decided to secretly jam all communications to make the outside world believe nobody had survived. They then receive a radio broadcast from Moscow Defense Command calling for survivors to rally at the \"Ark\" located at Mount Yamantau and Miller decides to head there, believing that the Ark is where the Russian government has rebuilt itself. After crossing the cult-controlled Volga River, the Spartans reach the Yamantau base and discover that the base\\\\\\'s service crew have devolved into cannibals luring survivors in with the false promise of safety. Artyom and the Spartans manage to fight their way out and escape, but Miller\\\\\\'s faith in Russia is shattered when he discovers that the government never took refuge in Yamantau, or even survived the war, and thus the Spartans are left wondering what to do next. Using a map they recovered from Yamantau, they decide to travel to a satellite communication center near the Caspian Sea in the hopes of gaining access to a satellite to find habitable land to settle. At the dried up remains of the Caspian Sea, the Spartans steal water and fuel from the local bandits while obtaining an updated satellite map. As the Spartans continue on their journey, Anna begins to cough up blood, fearing the cause was accidentally breathing poison gas during the journey. They decide to scout a nearby taiga forest valley to see if it is suitable to settle. While scouting the forest, Artyom is caught between two rival survivor factions, and he discovers that the dam protecting the valley from radiation is on the verge of failing, making the area uninhabitable. Artyom returns to the train to learn Anna\\\\\\'s condition has worsened. The only chance to save Anna is to find the antidote in Novosibirsk, but the entire city is heavily irradiated. Miller and Artyom decide to head into the city alone to search for the antidote despite the risk. They enter the Novosibirsk Metro and find a young boy named Kiril, one of the last of the Novosibirsk survivors. Kiril explains that his father left on a mission to obtain a map marking the location of a clean, habitable area. Miller decides to go find the map while Artyom heads out to find the antidote. He manages to recover the antidote, but is gravely wounded by a mutant and absorbs a heavy dose of radiation. Artyom, Miller, and Kiril return to the train with the map and the antidote, but Miller dies of radiation poisoning on the way back after using a dose of anti-radiation serum meant for himself to save Artyom. The rest of the Spartans donate their own blood to give Artyom a critical blood transfusion. Anna is cured with the antidote and with the map, the Spartans settle on the shores of Lake Baikal, which is completely free from radiation. Artyom\\\\\\'s ultimate fate depends on the choices the player made during the journey. In the bad ending, Artyom dies from the radiation poisoning, and the Spartans and a grieving Anna hold a funeral for him and Miller while Artyom\\\\\\'s spirit awakens on a dilapidated version of the Aurora. Artyom, along with the spirit of Miller and other characters, remain in this ghostly purgatory for eternity. In the good ending, Artyom survives. Miller is buried and Artyom is selected to take his place as leader of the Spartan Order. Now that they have a home, Artyom decides to return to Moscow and reveal the truth of the world to the survivors of the Metro. \\n Development and release \\n Metro Exodus is developed by 4A Games. Development of the game began in 2014 at 4A Games\\\\\\' studios in Malta and Kiev. The game uses the 4A Engine. Metro Exodus was announced on 11 June 2017 at Microsoft\\\\\\'s press conference during E3 2017. The game was released for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One on 15 February 2019. The first expansion pack, The Two Colonels, released in October 2019. The second expansion, titled Sam\\\\\\'s Story, is set to be released in early 2020. \\n Epic Games Store controversy \\n On 28 January 2019, it was announced that the PC release would be exclusive to the Epic Games Store for one year, with the publisher citing the platform\\\\\\'s more favourable revenue split. The game\\\\\\'s pre-sales were discontinued on Steam following the announcement, with existing Steam digital purchases still being fulfilled. The decision caused controversy, and resulted in a large number of players calling for a boycott of the game and review bombing the franchise\\\\\\'s previous games on Steam. One of the game\\\\\\'s developers was criticised in the gaming press for stating on a forum that if Metro Exodus did not sell well on the Epic Games Store, its sequels may become console exclusives. 4A Games released a statement that these views did not represent those of the company. \\n Sales \\n In its release month, Metro Exodus claimed the number two on the UK\\\\\\'s sales charts. Metro Exodus also sold 50% more copies than its predecessor, Metro: Last Light. In Japan, approximately 17,513 physical units for PS4 were sold during its launch week becoming the number 7 selling game of any format.\\'b\\' \\n Eiji Yoshikawa \\n Life \\n He was born Hidetsugu Yoshikawa Yoshikawa Hidetsugu) in Kanagawa Prefecture, in what is now a part of Yokohama. Because of his father\\\\\\'s failed business, he had to drop out of primary school to work when he was 11 years old. When he was 18, after a near-fatal accident working at the Yokohama docks, he moved to Tokyo and became an apprentice in a gold lacquer workshop. Around this time he became interested in comic haiku. He joined a poetry society and started writing comic haiku under the pseudonym \"Kijiro\". In 1914, with The Tale of Enoshima, he won first prize in a novel-writing contest sponsored by the publisher Kodansha. He joined the newspaper Maiyu Shimbun in 1921, and in the following year he began publishing serializations, starting with Life of Shinran. He married Yasu Akazawa in 1923, the year of the Great earthquake. His experiences in the earthquake strengthened his resolve to make writing his career. In the following years he published stories in various periodicals published by Kodansha, who recognized him as their number one author. He used 19 pen names before settling on Eiji Yoshikawa. He first used this pen name with the serialization of Sword Trouble, Woman Trouble. His name became a household word after Secret Record of Naruto was serialized in the Osaka Mainichi Shimbun; from then on his writing became much more popular. In the early 1930s, his writing became introspective, reflecting growing troubles in his personal life. But in 1935, with the serialization of Musashi, about famed swordsman Miyamoto Musashi, in the Asahi Shimbun, his writing settled firmly into the genre of historical adventure fiction. Upon the outbreak of war with China in 1937 the Asahi Shimbun sent him into the field as a special correspondent. At this time he divorced Yasu Akazawa and married Fumiko Ikedo. During the war he continued writing novels, and became more influenced by Chinese culture. Among the works of this period are Taiko and his re-telling of the Romance of the Three Kingdoms. At the end of the war he stopped writing for a while and settled down to enjoy a quiet retirement in Yoshino (present-day Oumeshi) on the outskirts of Tokyo, but by 1947 he had started writing again. His post-war works include New Tale of the Heike, published in the Asahi Weekly (1950), and A Private Record of the Pacific War (1958). On September 7, 1962, he died from cancer-related complications. \\n English translations \\n Four of his books have been translated into English. They are:\\'b\\' \\n Gatsi and Gaim \\n Gatsi (Georgian: and Gaim or Ga, were, according to the medieval Georgian chronicles, the deities in a pre-Christian pantheon of ancient Georgians of Kartli (Iberia of the Classical sources). The Georgian hagiographic work \"The Life of St. Nino\" reports that when St. Nino, a 4th-century female Christian baptizer of Georgians, arrived at the city of Mtskheta, she saw that on the right side of the chief idol of Armazi \"there stood another image, made of gold, with the face of a man. Its name was Gatsi, and on the left of it was a silver idol with a human face, the name of which was Gaim.\" Another passage from the medieval chronicle relates that Gatsi and Ga(im) were believed to have governed \"all of mysteries.\" Beyond the passages from the medieval Georgian annals, we lack contemporary records and archaeological evidence about these cults, however. Both these deities, reportedly brought by the semi-legendary ruler Azoy from his original homeland Arian-Kartli, may have been a version of the Anatolian Attis and Cybele.\\'b\\' \\n Crusaders F.C.

The two countries have had diplomatic relations since 1974. Additionally, Switzerland has long been a mediator party in talks between the involved parties of the conflict in the Korean peninsula (North Korea, South Korea, China, Japan, Russia, and the United States) most recently with the North Korea crisis. Swiss President Doris Leuthard identified her country as being able to host such talks again in September 2017.

It is on the eastern bank of the lower Mataura River, inland from Toetoes Bay.  Pine Bush is nearby to the northeast, and Waimahaka is to the southeast. \\n Railway \\n On 18 June 1899, an extension of the Seaward Bush Branch was opened from Gorge Road to Waimahaka; the only intermediate station was situated in Titiroa.  This branch line railway linked Titiroa with Invercargill, approximately away by rail.  Passengers were carried on daily mixed trains; these were cut to operate once weekly in 1951, and after this point were operated mainly for the benefit of New Zealand Railways Department employees and their families who lived in the area.  Goods-only trains operated on the other days, and on 1 June 1960 they became the sole trains through Titiroa as the weekly mixed was cancelled.  The line officially closed on 31 March 1966 as freight levels had not been profitable for years.  Some of the line\\'s old formation can still be seen in the vicinity of Titiroa. \\n Titiroa Mountain \\n A 1715m Peak known as Mount Titiroa stands alone on the Eastern flank of the Hunter Mountains of Fiordland National Park and it is a prominent landmark throughout the Te Anau Basin of Northern Southland.\"b\\' \\n Aloud \\\\\\'n\\\\\\' Live \\n Reception \\n Ian Cross of The Canberra Times observed that their \"sound is simple, hard rock and roll, yet it has a sense of originality about it.

Tracks were laid southwards from Whitehaven and Moor Row as far as Egremont by the Whitehaven, Cleator and Egremont Railway, opening to passengers on 1 July 1857. By the 1860s the company sought to extend southwards from Egremont to meet the coastal line at Sellafield, aiming for Millom, Barrow-in-Furness and beyond. The Furness opposed this, but the two companies came to an accommodation and built the Egremont to Sellafield extension as a joint line. St Thomas Cross Platform was a Twentieth Century addition to the line. A service from Moor Row to Beckermet Mines, calling at Woodend, Egremont and St Thomas Cross was started on 15 January 1912, though it is possible that other workmen\\\\\\'s services called before then, as Florence Mine was nearby.  The use of the term \"Platform\" usually signified that a station was an unstaffed halt. The halt must have been closed by 1933, when the structure was demolished. It was used by workers at the nearby Florence mine, which went on to be the last operating iron ore mine, as opposed to quarry, in Western Europe. It closed in 2008. The halt does not appear on the relevant 1928 Railway Clearing House junction diagram or in Jowett. The station is not marked on contemporary OS maps up to 6\" to the Mile, but an unlabelled building with a footpath to the road is shown in the right place on the Cumberland 1:2,500 scale OS map linked below via Old OS Maps.\\'b\\' \\n Reuben H. Walworth \\n Early life and education \\n Reuben Walworth was the third son of merchant and American Revolutionary War quartermaster Benjamin Walworth (1746-1812), who after that war (in 1782) had married the widow Apphia (Hyde Cardell) Walworth (1757-1837). Reuben Walworth was born in Bozrah, New London County, Connecticut (his mother\\\\\\'s hometown) in 1788, and named to honor a maternal uncle. In 1792 Reuben Walworth received a land grant for his wartime service and moved his family moved to Hoosick, Rensselaer County, New York, where he operated a mill. They had eleven children; most of their sons became associated with the New York state courts. His eldest, John Walsworth (1784-1839) rose the rank of Major during the Revolutionary War and moved to Clinton County, New York where he served many years as clerk of the court before in 1829 moving to New York City and serving as Assistant Registrar of the Court of Chancery. Their second son, James Clinton Walworth (1787-1871), would become a merchant in Argyle, New York before becoming a judge in Otsego County, New York and serving for decades. The fourth son, Dr. Benjamin Walworth (1792 - 1879), became a leading citizen of Fredonia and for decades served as judge in Chautauqua County, New York. Educated in the local schools, Reuben Walworth began teaching school when he was 16 (1804-5). He then began reading law in Troy, the Rensselaer county seat, under the guidance of John Russel. Princeton University would award him an honorary LL.D. degree in 1835, Yale University in 1839 and Harvard University in 1848. \\n Career \\n Admitted to the New York bar in 1809, in January, 1810 Walworth moved to Plattsburgh, the Clinton County county seat and where his eldest brother Major John Walsworth served as clerk of the court. In 1811 Reuben Walworth was appointed a master of chancery, one of the local judges and whose particular responsibilities included overseeing and protecting widows and orphans, as well as issuing injunctions against nuisances. During the War of 1812, Walworth served as adjutant-general of the New York militia, and as aide to General Benjamin Mooers. In September 1814, the British invaded Plattsburg, and Walworth from shore of Lake Champlain observed the naval victory of Commandant Thomas Macdonough in the Battle of Lake Champlain. He attained the rank  of colonel and headed the division\\\\\\'s judge advocate general corps by the war\\\\\\'s end. His youngest brother Hiram Walworth (1799-1870) distinguished himself in the battle for the Saranac bridge in that war, and would later become a lawyer and serve for many years under their brother John in New York City. A midshipman in that battle, Charles Theodore Platt, would later become his brother-in-law. Their father also died in 1812, killed by one of his horses; his mother would survive another 25 years, cared for by family in upstate New York. Voters elected Walworth as a Democratic-Republican to the 17th United States Congress. Serving alongside fellow Democratic-Republican Nathaniel Pitcher (a future New York governor) in what was then New York\\\\\\'s 12th congressional district from December 3, 1821, to March 3, 1823, Walworth did not seek re-election in what became a one-representative district after census-based redistricting. During his Congressional term, in April 1823, Walworth was appointed Judge of the New York Fourth Circuit Court. In October he moved to Saratoga Springs, Saratoga County, New York. Five years later, in 1828, Walworth was appointed Chancellor of New York, and continued to conduct court in his parlor. He remained in office until July 1847 when the State Constitution of 1846 abolished the office. Walworth wrote Rules and Orders of the New York Court of Chancery (Albany, 1829; several revised eds.), which greatly influenced equity practice in the United States. Walworth gained President John Tyler\\\\\\'s attention because of his widely respected opinions on evidence, pleadings, civil procedure, and arbitration. Tyler nominated him to the Supreme Court of the United States three times in 1844, but the nomination was always postponed due to Tyler\\\\\\'s lack of support from both Whigs and the Democrats. In 1848, Walworth was the Hunkers\\\\\\' candidate for Governor of New York, but was defeated in a three-way race by Whig Hamilton Fish. In 1850, the United States Supreme Court appointed Walworth to serve as a commissioner (now special master) in litigation concerning the new Wheeling Suspension Bridge, the first bridge to cross a major river west of the Appalachian Mountains. The justices had divided during the previous years concerning the scope of the federal power in the Commerce Clause as well as concurrent state powers. In 1847, in U.S. v. New Bedford Bridge Company Justice Levi Woodbury on circuit duty had determined that no federal law defined obstruction of navigable waterways and upheld a drawbridge near the port, and Justice Samuel Nelson had done similarly while a justice of the New York Supreme Court. The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania (through its attorney general Cornelius Darragh) and Pittsburgh interests represented by Edwin M. Stanton and Robert J. Walker had brought this litigation in the United States Supreme Court by seeking an injunction against the bridge from the justice responsible for that geographic area, former Pennsylvania judge for the Pittsburgh area, Robert C. Grier. The Wheeling Bridge Company was represented by Charles W. Russell and U.S. Attorney general Reverdy Johnson (supposedly in a private capacity but who had denied Pennsylvania\\\\\\'s request for his federal office\\\\\\'s assistance)), among others. They argued the bridge helped the U.S. mails (delayed during ice and high and low water periods), connected military outposts, and that the public had a right to cross the river. Crucial to the equity required for the sought-after injunction, they argued, Pennsylvania had delayed two years while the bridge was under construction, as well as failed to prove irremediable injury (because technology also existed to lower steamboat smokestacks, as was necessary to use a downriver canal near Louisville, Kentucky. After Justice Grier held a hearing in Philadelphia on August 16, 1849, on August 30 he refused the requested injunction to remove the bridge. Instead, he referred the matter to the full court. That heard argument on February 25, 1850, reviewed extensive depositions (361 printed pages) and then on May 29, 1850, Justice Nelson (over a dissent by Justice Peter V. Daniel who would have refused jurisdiction altogether) issued a one-page order appointing Walworth as commissioner. Walworth received much scientific and commercial evidence, including a report from U.S. Army engineer William Jarvis McAlpine. However, both parties were dissatisfied with Walworth\\\\\\'s 770 page report, which he issued in December 1851. Pittsburgh was disappointed that Walworth refused to order the bridge removed. Virginia and Ohio interests complained because he found the waterway obstructed and recommended raising the bridge an additional 20 would cause enormous technical difficulties and additional cost. However, after reviewing both parties\\\\\\' exceptions, receiving another report from McAlpine and hearing more argument on February 23 and 24, the U.S. Supreme Court also refused to order the bridge removed, but instead amended the new required height to 111 feet. However, the bridge then disintegrated during an May 1854 windstorm and was rebuilt in eight weeks despite an injunction against such by Justice Grier (hence the 1856 litigation).  Nonetheless, Walworth\\\\\\'s report undergirded the Court\\\\\\'s decisions in both 1852 as well as 1856 (the latter decision also relying on additional federal legislation). Completion of the B&O Railroad to Wheeling, and competition from a new steamboat line connection Wheeling with Louisville proved fatal to both steamboat companies, who soon dismantled their ships or sold them downriver for the Mississippi trade. Furthermore, additional bridges across the Ohio River were proposed for Parkersburg, Bellaire and Steubenville. A truss pivot drawbridge across the Mississippi River between Davenport, Iowa and Rock Island, Illinois was completed in 1856. Returning to private legal practice, Walworth grew wealthy representing railroads in other litigation. He expanded the family mansion. As the American Civil War neared, Walworth advocated peace and conciliation. A delegate at the Peace Conference of 1861] after the election of President Abraham Lincoln, his speech was published and circulated. As discussed below, his son Mansfield Walworth failed to receive a deferment from conscription during the American Civil War and was imprisoned for three month in 1864 as a suspected Confederate spy until released and restricted to the Saratoga Springs vicinity. However, his stepson Martin Davis Hardin (1837-1892), a West Point graduate, remained in the Union Army, distinguished himself in battle, and was promoted to General. \\n Personal life \\n Walworth married twice. On January 16, 1812, Reuben Walworth married Maria Ketchum Averill They had four daughters and two sons. Both sons initially became lawyers and then writers, but also created widely different scandals of their era, as discussed below. After mourning Maria\\\\\\'s death for four years, Walworth in Harrodsburg, Mercer County, Kentucky in 1851 married Sarah Ellen (Smith) Hardin, widow of Congressman John J. Hardin who had died in the Mexican American War and whose daughter Ellen Hardin  was then 19. Walsworth\\\\\\'s eldest son, Clarence A. Walworth was admitted to the New York bar in 1841, and after studies at the General Theological Seminary in New York, converted from the Protestant Episcopal Church to Catholicism, a scandal in the era of the Know Nothing party. Rev. Walworth became a missionary within the United States, and his brother and wife were among those he converted to Catholicism. He also published books about his new faith as well as history (including his family), and became one of the five founders of the Paulist Fathers. His temperamental brother, Mansfield Tracy Walworth after graduation from Harvard Law School became a novelist. In 1852 he married his stepsister, and had several children. Mansfield Walworth never completed the legal history his father wanted, but instead wrote lurid novels, and was ultimately disinherited by his father in favor of his wife/step-sister and progeny. During the American Civil War, he failed to receive a deferment from conscription, but secured a staff position in 1863, only to be imprisoned for three months in Capitol Prison as a suspected Confederate spy in 1864, before being released on orders of Gen. Fremont but restricted to the Saratoga Springs vicinity. To his father\\\\\\'s dismay, Mansfield Walworth regularly abused his wife. In 1873 their son Francis Hardin \"Frank\" Walworth (1853-1883), invited his father to a New York City hotel room, then shot him four times, killing him. The trial caused a sensation, his lawyers arguing for acquittal by reason of insanity and the judge allowed Mansfield\\\\\\'s abusive letters to his wife into evidence. Convicted of a lesser charge, his mother secured his release in 1877. A devout Presbyterian, Walworth became an elder and known for charity toward the poor. A Freemason, he rose to Grand Master in the Grand Lodge of New York in 1853. He was also vice-president of the Bible Society and the Tract Society, and for a long period president of the American Temperance Union. Walworth also wrote Hyde Genealogy (2 vols., 1864), and was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1865. \\n Death and legacy \\n Walworth died in Saratoga Springs on November 28, 1867, survived by his wife, children and several grandchildren. He is buried at Greenridge Cemetery in Saratoga Springs. Walworth County, Wisconsin and Walworth, New York were named for him. His stepdaughter inherited the family mansion, Pine Grove, which the Chancellor had expanded to 55 rooms (including a courtroom). It survived a century, but was torn down after his granddaughter died, Saratoga Springs having become a racing and gambling center. Several rooms are recreated in the Saratoga Springs History Museum. A Christian campground open from May to November for more than 80 years has the name.\\'b\\' \\n Ball Fighter \\n Gameplay \\n Ball Fighter is a puzzle game for one or two players. The mechanics is based on removing colored spheres from the well. Spheres move from the top of the screen to the bottom and when they reach the bottom, a player loses the game. The player has to catch the spheres and throw them back to the well to connect at least three of the same color in one column and to make them disappear. Additional bonuses can make the game easier for the player or more difficult for the opponent. Besides standard sphere removal and removal with the bonus spheres the player can make combos. The combo is made if the player removes more than two sphere chains fast, one after another. It can be done either automatically (dropping spheres connect into chains) or activated by the player (if the player is fast then he or she can throw new spheres before the combo bar drops to zero). Combos allow the player to earn much more points in the single-player modes and put more spheres in the well in the multiplayer mode. \\n Reception \\n Ball Fighter received an overall score of 7/10 from Nintendo Life.\\'b\\' \\n Devasish Roy \\n Career \\n Devasish Roy is a Barrister by profession and served as a Special Assistant to the Chief Advisor of Bangladesh (Head of the Interim Government) with rank and status of a State Minister during the Bangladeshi political crisis. He was in charge of the Ministry of Chittagong Hill Tracts Affairs and the Ministry of Forest and Environment. Roy became King of the Chakma Circle after his father Tridev Roy went into exile following the independence of Bangladesh from Pakistan in 1971. In the 1970 general election Raja Tridev Roy had been elected to the National Assembly of Pakistan as one of the only two non-Awami League candidates from East Pakistan. The former Raja who opposed the independence of Bangladesh fled Rangamati and escaped to Pakistan at the end of the Bangladesh Liberation War. However most of the royal family, including the Rani and Yuvraj, were still left at the Rangamati Palace. After the emergence of Bangladesh, Yuvraj Devasish Roy was proclaimed Raja due to the absence of his father. \\n Personal life \\n Roy was married to Tatu Roy until her death in 1998. The couple have two children, a son named Tribhuvan Aryadev Roy (b. 1990), and a daughter named Ayetri Aradhan Roy (b. 1994). His son was made the Yuvraj (crown prince) in 2003. On 4 July 2014, he married architect and indigenous social worker Yan Yan, an ethnic Rakhine.  The couple have a son, Yoddha Devayana Roy (b. 2016).\\'b\" \\n Voices.com \\n History \\n Voices.com was founded in 2003 by husband and wife David and Stephanie Ciccarelli and was officially incorporated in 2004 in Ontario, Canada. Prior to founding the company, David studied audio engineering at the Ontario Institute of Audio Recording Technology, and operated a recording studio. Through the studio, Ciccarelli met his eventual wife, a musician and vocalist studying at University of Western Ontario. As his studio received more and more inquiries from actors looking for voiceover work, the pair saw the opportunity to connect the actors with businesses looking to hire voice talent and decided to focus on creating an online marketplace instead of producing content. The original name for the business was Interactive Voices. Later, it purchased the website Voices.com for $30,000 from the medical journal Silencing the Critical Voices in Your Head. In 2006, the company\\'s CEO was criticized for claiming that the Google radio ad product, was nearly identical to the one offered by Voices.com despite having not seen it. In 2011,  the company moved its headquarters from Western University\\'s research park to a larger space in downtown London, Ontario. From February to May 2013, the company participated in the Canadian Technology Incubator in Silicon Valley. The Ciccarellis\\' book, Voice Acting for Dummies was published In 2013. In 2014, the company launched its first non-English site, for Spanish speakers in Latin America. That same year, the company began a $3.6 million expansion project supported by the Federal Economic Development Agency for Southern Ontario. In April 2015, Voices.com raised $2 million in funding from a division of the Business Development Bank of Canada. As part of the 2015 Canada Technology Accelerator, the company set up a temporary office in New York City. In 2016, the company relocated to a roughly 45,000 square foot location in downtown London, Ontario. Voices.com raised $18 million in funding from Morgan Stanley Expansion Capital in July 2017. In August 2017, the company purchased the California-based Voicebank.net, an online casting and project management platform for an undisclosed amount. \\n Overview \\n Voices.com is a platform that provides prices for different kinds of voice services, such as commercials or voicemail messages. Actors are not required to join a union to secure work on Voices.com and can audition for all jobs after joining the company\\'s marketplace, however some of the clients seeking voice actors for national network campaigns, feature films, movie trailers and video game work require that talent joins the SAG-AFTRA union. It also has a library of articles to educate users about the voice acting industry and trends in the field. It allows employers in small markets to connect with voice actors in other regions, as well as connecting larger companies with voice actors. The site offers freelancers in more than 100 languages and dialects. Beside each freelancer\\'s name there is a demo of the person\\'s voice that employers can listen to. In May 2012, the website launched an app for iPad and iPhone devices, followed by the release of an app for Android devices in January 2013, both allowing job seekers to interact with potential employers directly over their mobile devices. The company added an app for the Apple watch in 2015. Clients that have worked with Voices.com include ESPN, PBS, The History Channel, Digest, NBC, DreamWorks Animation, Sony, and Greer & Associates.\"b\" \\n Milkman \\n A milkman is a delivery person who delivers milk, often directly to customers\\' houses, in bottles or cartons. \\n Delivery \\n Milk was delivered to houses daily in some countries when a lack of good refrigeration meant milk would quickly spoil. Before milk bottles were available, milkmen took churns on their rounds and filled the customers\\' jugs by dipping a measure into the churn. The near-ubiquity of refrigerators in homes in the developed world, as well as improved packaging, has decreased the need for frequent milk delivery over the past half-century and made the trade shrink in many localities sometimes to just three days a week and disappear totally in others. Additionally, milk delivery incurs a small cost on the price of dairy products that is increasingly difficult to justify and leaves delivered milk in a position where it is vulnerable to theft. Milk deliveries frequently occur in the morning and it is not uncommon for milkmen and milkwomen to deliver products other than milk such as eggs, cream, cheese, butter, yogurt, or soft drinks. In some areas, apartments and houses would have small milk-delivery doors. A small wooden cabinet inside of the residence, built into the exterior wall, would have doors on both sides that were latched but not locked. Milk or groceries could be placed in the box when delivered and collected by the homeowner. \\n Vehicles \\n Horse-drawn vehicles were originally used. These were still seen in Britain in the 1950s and parts of the United States until the 1960s. Now, motorized vehicles are used. \\n Europe \\n Milkmen appeared in Britain around 1860 when the first railroads allowed fresh milk to arrive in cities from the countryside, and by 1880, the milk was delivered in bottles. By 1975, 94% of milk was in glass bottles, but by 1990, supermarkets offered plastic and carton containers, reducing bottled milk to 3% by 2016. From the 20th century, milk delivery in urban areas of Europe has been carried out from an electric vehicle called a milk float. \\n Australia \\n In Australia, the delivery vehicle was usually a small petrol or diesel engined truck with a covered milk-tray. In hotter areas, this tray is usually insulated. \\n Asia \\n In India, those delivering milk usually use milk churns, a practice that has ceased in western countries. On the road, they are put on any kind of vehicle. In big cities such as Mumbai, milk churns are often transported in luggage compartments in local trains. In the Philippines, the milkman or milkmaid is called lechero. The tradition stemmed from the community production of carabao milk. The lechero delivers the fresh carabao milk to the barangay (village) of his or her designation. The lechero heritage used to be widely practiced in the country, however, it declined after the introduction of store-bought milk during the American-occupation period. Nowadays, only a few communities have lecheros, notably in Nueva Ecija province, the milk capital of the Philippines. \\n Americas \\n In 1963, nearly 29.7 percent of consumers had milk delivered, but by 1975, the number had dropped to 6.9 percent of total sales. In 2005, about 0.4% of consumers in the United States had their milk delivered, and a handful of newer companies had sprung up to offer the service.  Some U.S. dairies have been delivering milk for about a hundred years, with interest continuing to increase in the 2010s as part of the local food movement.\"b\" \\n Stefan Rusconi \\n Work \\n Since 2004 along with Fabian Gisler (bass) and Claudio (drums) he\\'s playing with his band Rusconi across the world. So far they release six records on indie and major labels such as Bee Jazz Records and Sony Music Entertainment. Since 2012 they\\'re running their own boutique label Qilin Records on which they release their music and the music of other musician friends.  2011 he composed the music for the cinema documentary Tinguely directed by Thomas   Also in 2011 together with the pianist und producer Ephrem he founded the experimental electronica duo Whistler&Hustler, which released 2013 the album The Whistler&Hustler Session on Qilin Records. He wrote the music for the stage play Kinder der Sonne by Maxim Gorki directed by Nora Schlocker, which premiered 2015 at the opera Basel. Also 2015 along with Paul Lemp (bass) and Marc Lohr (drums) he composed the music for Until our Hearts Stop directed by the American choreographer Meg Stuart, which was coproduced by Kammerspiele and the Ruhrtriennale. The production in which he plays electronics, trumpet and piano is now touring Europe. He also collaborated with Fred Frith, Thomas Wydler, Pipilotti Rist, Norma Winstone, Tobias Preisig, Dieter Meier, the ARTE Quartett and Till \\n Avram \\n Avram (Serbian: 12 March 1756 in Sombor 20 February 1826 in Sombor) was a Serbian writer, translator, pedagogue, aristocrat and Senator of the Free Royal City of Sombor, part of the Military Frontier of the Austrian Empire. \\n Biography \\n Avram was the son of Reverend and Mr. Georgije parish priest of the Serbian Orthodox Church of Saint John the Baptist in Sombor. is known in literary annals as a Serbian education reformer who lived and worked in the Habsburg Empire in Serb and Romanian territories of today\\\\\\'s Serbian Vojvodina and Romanian Banat at the same time as Teodor Mirijevski and Stefan Vujanovski. He is the first director of the Serb National Primary School Commission after being named to the post by his mentor, Teodor He also founded Norma (Normal school), a teacher training college in Sombor in 1778 before another school was opened in 1812 in Szentendre called Regium Pedagogium Nationis Illiricae (Preparandium in Latin or Preparadija in Serbian) which eventually was relocated back to Sombor in 1816. wrote and published Rukovodstvo k slavenstej grammatice: vo upotreblenik slaveno-serbskih narodnyh ucilisc (a Serbian grammar with correct syntax) in Vienna in 1794 for Serbian schools. He credited Meletius Smotrytsky\\\\\\'s 1619 work as his inspiration.  The first book on logic in the Serbian language was written by Nikola Avram friend, and was published in Budapest in two volumes, entitled \"Logic\"  (Vol. I, 1808; Vol. II, 1809). Ten years later, wrote the second book on logic in Serbian in a similar manner, entitled \"Logic, or Reasoning\", completed in 1826, the year he died. The book was not published.  Aside from Pavle Julinac, remembered as the first to translate from French, other translators of the period were Gligorije Nikola Atanasije and Avram translated the French work of Jeanne-Marie Leprince de Beaumont,  and the Latin of Ovid, Cicero, Virgil, Horace, and the Greek of Aristotle.\\'b\" \\n Jungler \\n Gameplay \\n In Jungler, the player controls a white, multi-segmented animal inside a blue maze. Also inside the maze are three enemy creatures similar to that of the player. The object of the game is to eliminate the enemy creatures before one of them eliminates the player. When all three enemies are defeated, the player advances to the next maze. The enemy creatures appear in one of three colors: red, yellow or green. Red creatures are longer in length than the player, and as such a collision with the creature will cost the player one life. Yellow creatures are the same length as the player, thus posing no harm upon a collision. Green creatures are shorter than the player, and will be devoured by the player\\'s creature if they collide. The player can shoot at the creatures, with each hit reducing the number of segments by one. As segments are removed, the creatures are able to move faster, thus making them harder to catch and eliminate. Points are scored for shooting the creatures, as well as for collecting pieces of fruit that appear in the maze at random locations. These fruits will also add an extra segment to the player\\'s creature. \\n Ports \\n The only contemporary home system ports of Jungler were by Emerson for the Tomy Tutor in 1981 and also for Emerson\\'s Arcadia 2001 console in 1982. Gakken made a tabletop handheld game of Jungler in 1982 as part of a series of flip-top games with VFD screen and magnifying Fresnel lens. \\n Legacy \\n Much in the way that Space Panic remained obscure, but a home clone from Broderbund was a hit in the guise of Apple Panic, the Jungler concept found success in a computer clone, also from Broderbund: Serpentine. Jungler was one of the first titles made available by Microsoft for its now defunct Game Room service for the Xbox 360 and Games for Windows - LIVE in March 2010. \\n World record \\n In May 1983, Joe Startz of Kenosha, Wisconsin set the Jungler world record with a score of 180,720 points.\"b\" \\n Lady Helen\\'s Escapade \\n Plot \\n Lady Helen (Florence Lawrence) is a wealthy yet immensely bored woman who lives in a luxurious home with her three servants. In seek of adventure, she answers a help wanted in the newspaper and goes slumming as a domestic servant in a boarding house. She makes ludicrous efforts to cook, serve food, and clean, how ever the men living in the boarding house are enamored with her beauty and charm enough to overlook her incompetence. Among the boarders is a tall handsome violinist (David Miles), whose kindness and musical talent stand out among the crass manners of the other men. Helen and the violinist\\'s romance inspires jealousy among the other maid, who conspire to get rid of Helen by framing her for the theft of the musician\\'s violin. Although the violinist believes Helen is innocent, she is still fired and sent away. Helen soon reveals her true identity and reunites with the musician. After their reunion, Helen secures the violinist a position as a director at a conservatory. \\n Production \\n As was the case with most of the films Griffith made during this period, most of the film\\'s props and costumes were recycled from other productions. Lawrence, the film\\'s star, creatively utilized the recycled costumes to stand out and support her character, and some writers credit her work in Lady Helen\\'s Escapade as the first to use of costume design. The film has a large cast that often appeared in the same many as nine performers appeared simultaneously in a single Griffith could not use close-ups to convey meaning and emotion. To compensate for this, the actors had to exaggerate their movements and gesticulations. As a result, much of the acting in the film resembles traditional stage performance rather than the more subtle performances associated with film.\"b\\' \\n Cimze \\n Early life \\n Cimze was born at the Rauna Manor\\\\\\'s Cimze dairy farm (hoflage) in the family of a manor\\\\\\'s dairy farm overseer Andreas (Ansis) Cimze and his wife Anne as the first child of 8 for his parents. His initial education came from Rauna Parish School where he also learned to play the organ. From the age of sixteen he worked as a private tutor; later he was a teacher at Valmiera Parish School and an organist. \\n Education \\n In 1836 Cimze went to Germany to study at Weissenfels Teachers\\\\\\' Seminary which he finished in 1838. This was where he learned to play the violin and piano and improved his skills as an organist. In he was an external student at Berlin University where he attended lectures on mathematics, didactics and the theory of music. His music professor was Ludwig Christian Erk, a collector, harmoniser, publisher and researcher of German folk songs. \\n Vidzeme Teachers\\\\\\' Seminary \\n Upon returning from Germany, from 1839 and to the end of his life, Cimze headed Vidzeme Teachers\\\\\\' Seminary where he taught future teachers the conducting of choirs and harmonisation of folk songs. Cimze followed the principles of Johann Pestalozzi and Adolph Diesterweg and all education was conducted in German. During his forty-two years of work at the Teachers\\\\\\' Seminary Cimze educated more than four hundred students who subsequently became Latvian and Estonian teachers. Being a teacher in the 19th century meant being also an educator, a musician, a literary and public figure. In the second half of the 19th century teachers organised choirs and worked with them and cultural societies. \\n Musical legacy \\n Cimze promoted the development of Latvian choral singing and the cultivation of a cappella performance. His collection of songs for choirs \"Dziesmu rota\" (A Garland of Songs) was published in eight parts in This first ever professional collection of songs for choirs in Latvia formed the foundation of Latvian choir culture. Parts II (1872), III (1874), IV (1875) and VII (1884) of \"Dziesmu rota\", which go under the title of \"Lauku (Wild Flowers), are the first collections of Latvian folk songs arrangements and represent a number of folk song genres: songs of seasons and family customs, work songs, farewell songs of recruits and conscripts, songs of orphans as well as songs for games and lullabies. Cimze was the first prominent Latvian figure in music, whose example inspired extensive collection, publishing, arrangement and research of folk music. It fostered the development of the choir-singing movement and the creation of new original compositions. Thanks to the activities of Cimze and his students, the first All-Estonian (1869) and All-Latvian (1873) Song Festivals were held. Cimze was among those who conceived the idea of the event, while his student and associate was one of the chief conductors at the Song Festival. The programme of the Song Festival included several arrangements of folk songs by Cimze and his brother Cimze\\\\\\'s German sentiments surfaced as he compared the three brothers making the dowry-chest for their sister in the song dimd\" (Riga resounds) to the German nobility, the Lutheran Church and the German Riga. For this he was severely criticised by Atis Kronvalds.\\'b\" \\n Percy Correll \\n Biography \\n Percy Edward Correll (also known as Percival) was born in 1892 in Adelaide, and died on 11 June 1974. He was cremated at Centennial Park Cemetery, Adelaide. \\n Australasian Antarctic Expedition \\n Correll was 19 years old and a science student at the University of Adelaide when he was selected to join Mawson\\'s expedition. He was selected as a mechanic and as assistant to wireless operator Walter Hannam. He took part in the Eastern Sledging journey with Cecil Madigan and Archibald McLean, exploring the coast near the Mertz Glacier. They were instructed to explore this area taking detailed records of magnetic, biological, topographical, meteorological and geological observations, as well as details of the surfaces including sastrugi and record distances and heights. The group left Cape Denison on 8 November 1912, reached their farthest point on 18 December 1912, and returned to base camp on 16 January 1913. Their return was delayed one day past their deadline due to blizzard conditions on their return which slowed their progress. During their trek the group explored the Mertz and Ninnis glaciers, travelled over dangerous stretches of coastal ice and glaciers, climbed Aurora Peak and reached Horn Bluff. They kept detailed records of geological features and mapped the environment as they travelled.  Correll left the main base on SY Aurora in February 1913 along with most of the expedition, while a smaller group stayed behind awaiting the return of the Far Eastern Party (comprising Mawson, Xavier Mertz and Belgrave Edward Sutton Ninnis). During the return trip, he acted as colour photographer. He returned to Adelaide in March 1913. Correll Nunatak is named after him.\"b\\' \\n Shire of Northam \\n History \\n In 1871, the Northam Road District was constituted under the Road Boards Act 1871. On 4 November 1879, the separate Northam Municipality was constituted to manage the town of Northam. The town expanded beyond the municipal boundaries (which were set at about and on 6 September 1957, the municipal boundaries were adjusted to bring all of Northam under it. The Road District lost a significant part of its population in this transfer. On 1 July 1961, the Road District became a shire under the Local Government Act 1960. \\n Amalgamation \\n In September 2006, the Shire received a report into the possibility of merging with the Town of Northam, and on 31 October 2006, the Local Government Advisory Board received a proposal to that effect from both councils. Public meetings in December 2006 announced that the new council would be known as the Shire of Northam, and would come into existence on 1 July 2007, initially operated by a board of commissioners (two from each entity plus an independent chair). In January 2007, the Local Government Advisory Board officially recommended to the Minister for Local Government that the amalgamation proceed. The Shire electors successfully petitioned for a referendum within their area, which was held on 28 April 2007. Prior to the election, the Shire of Northam itself took the unusual step of asking its electors not to vote, in order to deny the referendum the 50% of voters needed to constitute a valid poll under Clause 10 of Schedule 2.1 of the Local Government Act 1995. With a participation rate of 23.59%, a majority of 93% voted against the proposal. This 23.59% voter participation equates to 596 voters; less than the number that petitioned for the referendum in the first place. The amalgamation proceeded as planned and the first elections for seats in the new council were held in October 2007.\\'b\" \\n Transpose graph \\n In the mathematical and algorithmic study of graph theory, the converse, transpose or reverse of a directed graph G is another directed graph on the same set of vertices with all of the edges reversed compared to the orientation of the corresponding edges in G. That is, if G contains an edge (u,v) then the converse/transpose/reverse of G contains an edge (v,u) and vice versa. \\n Notation \\n The name converse arises because the reversal of arrows corresponds to taking the converse of an implication in logic. The name transpose is because the adjacency matrix of the transpose directed graph is the transpose of the adjacency matrix of the original directed graph.   There is no general agreement on preferred terminology. The converse is denoted symbolically as G\\', or other notations, depending on which terminology is used and which book or article is the source for the notation. \\n Applications \\n Although there is little difference mathematically between a graph and its transpose, the difference may be larger in computer science, depending on how a given graph is represented. For instance, for the web graph, it is easy to determine the outgoing links of a vertex, but hard to determine the incoming links, while in the reversal of this graph the opposite is true. In graph algorithms, therefore, it may sometimes be useful to construct the reversal of a graph, in order to put the graph into a form which is more suitable for the operations being performed on it. An example of this is Kosaraju\\'s algorithm for strongly connected components, which applies depth first search twice, once to the given graph and a second time to its reversal. \\n Related concepts \\n A skew-symmetric graph is a graph that is isomorphic to its own transpose graph, via a special kind of isomorphism that pairs up all of the vertices. The converse relation of a binary relation is the relation that reverses the ordering of each pair of related objects. If the relation is interpreted as a directed graph, this is the same thing as the transpose of the graph. In particular, the order dual of a partial order can be interpreted in this way as the transposition of a transitively-closed directed acyclic graph.\"b\\' \\n Brill railway station \\n Wotton Tramway \\n On 23 September 1868 the small Aylesbury and Buckingham Railway (A&BR) opened, linking the Great Western Railway\\\\\\'s station at Aylesbury to the London and North Western Railway\\\\\\'s Oxford to Bletchley line at Verney Junction. On 1 September 1894, London\\\\\\'s Metropolitan Railway (MR) reached Aylesbury, and shortly afterwards connected to the A&BR line, with local MR services running to Verney Junction from 1 April 1894. Through trains from the MR\\\\\\'s London terminus at Baker Street began on 1 January 1897. Richard Temple-Nugent-Brydges-Chandos-Grenville, 3rd Duke of Buckingham and Chandos, had long had an interest in railways, and had served as chairman of the London and North Western Railway from 1852 until 1861. In the early 1870s he decided to build a light railway to transport freight from his estates in Buckinghamshire to the A&BR\\\\\\'s line at Quainton Road. The first stage of the route, known as the Wotton Tramway, was a 4-mile line from Quainton Road via Wotton to a coal siding at Kingswood, and opened on 1 April 1871. Intended for use by horse trams, the line was built with longitudinal sleepers, to avoid horses tripping. \\n Extension to Brill \\n Lobbying from the nearby town of Brill for the introduction of passenger services on the line led to an extension from Wotton to a new terminus at the foot of Brill Hill, north of the hilltop town of Brill itself, in March 1872. Two mixed trains each day ran in each direction. With the extension to Brill opened the line was renamed the Brill Tramway. The Duke bought two Aveling and Porter traction engines modified to work as locomotives, each with a top speed of 8 miles per hour although a speed limit of 5 miles per hour was enforced. The Duke died in 1889. In 1894, the trustees of his estate set up the Oxford & Aylesbury Tramroad Company (O&ATC) with the intention of extending the line from Brill to Oxford, but the extension beyond Brill was never built. The MR leased the Brill Tramway from 1 December 1899, although the line continued to be owned by the O&ATC. \\n Services and facilities \\n Brill was a small town of 1,400 people when the line opened, and owing to the town\\\\\\'s hilltop setting the station was of a mile from Brill itself. Brill railway station was small, with a single low platform. At its opening there was one station building, which served as the freight depot, passenger terminal, and ticket office. Next to it was a siding that led to a cattle pen. Two cottages for station staff were built near the station in 1871. A third cottage across the road from the station was built in 1885, possibly to serve as an office. After the 1899 transfer of services to the Metropolitan Railway, the MR introduced a single Brown Marshall passenger carriage on the line; at this time, a small wooden hut was added to the station to serve as a ticket office and waiting room and a short section of platform was raised to conventional height to allow access to the higher doors on the new carriage. \\n Passenger services \\n From 1872 to 1894 the station was served by two passenger trains per day, and from 1895 to 1899 the number was increased to three per day. Following the 1899 transfer of services to the Metropolitan Railway, the station was served by four trains per day until its closure in 1935. Limited by poor-quality locomotives and ungraded, cheaply laid track which followed the contours of the hills, and with five intermediate stops to pick up and set down goods, passengers and livestock, trains ran very slowly; in 1887 trains needed to travel the six miles from Brill to the junction station at Quainton Road. Improvements to the line carried out at the time of the transfer to the Oxford & Aylesbury Tramroad, and the use of the MR\\\\\\'s better-quality rolling stock, reduced the journey time from Brill to Quainton Road to between 32 and 36 minutes. Serving a lightly populated area, and with trains travelling only marginally quicker than walking pace, Brill station saw relatively little use by passengers; in 1932, the last year of private operation, Brill station (and the nearby halt at Wood Siding) saw only 3,272 passenger journeys and raised only (about in 2019) in passenger receipts. \\n Goods facilities \\n Although little-used by passengers, Brill station was valuable as a relatively rapid link between the dairy farms of Buckinghamshire and the markets of Aylesbury and London; around 30 carts per day would deliver milk to Brill station for the first train each morning. There was also a small amount of coal traffic to the station; Brill coal dealer George Green received three coal wagons per month. In addition, a storehouse at the station held beer supplied by the breweries of Brackley and Aylesbury. Bricks and tiles from the brick and tile factories of Brill were used in the construction of Waddesdon Manor, near the eastern end of the Brill Tramway, between 1874 and 1889. In 1885 the Duke of Buckingham opened a modern brickworks near Brill station, with a dedicated siding, and in 1895 his heir William Temple-Gore-Langton, 4th Earl Temple of Stowe, expanded the brickworks, which became the Brill Brick & Tile Works, using the Brill Tramway to deliver bricks to the main line at Quainton Road. With the connection to Oxford and the upgrading of the rail line abandoned, Brill Brick & Tile Works was unable to compete with the nearby brickworks at Calvert, and soon closed. The building was taken over by the Fenemore workshop, making hay loaders, before being converted into a timber yard in the 1920s. \\n Closure \\n On 1 July 1933 the Metropolitan Railway, along with London\\\\\\'s other underground railways except for the small Waterloo & City Railway, was taken into public ownership as part of the newly formed London Passenger Transport Board (LPTB). Thus, despite it being 45 miles and over two hours\\\\\\' travel from the City of London, Brill station became a terminus of the London Underground network. Frank Pick, Managing Director of the Underground Group from 1928 and the Chief Executive of the LPTB, aimed to move the network away from freight services, and saw the lines beyond Aylesbury via Quainton Road to Brill and Verney Junction as having little future as financially viable passenger routes, concluding that over (about in 2019) would be saved by closing the Brill Tramway. As a consequence, the LPTB decided to withdraw all passenger services beyond Aylesbury. The Brill Tramway was closed on 1 December 1935; the last services ran on 30 November. Upon the withdrawal of London Transport services the lease expired, and the railway and stations reverted to the Oxford & Aylesbury Tramroad Company. With no funds and no rolling stock of its own, the O&ATC was unable to operate the line, and on 2 April 1936 the entire infrastructure of the line was sold at auction. The former goods shed at Brill sold for (about in 2019), and a railway-owned house attached to Brill station fetched (about in 2019). All buildings in Brill associated with the railway station have been demolished, with the exception of the station cottages, one of which is now called \"Sleepers\". The station site is now largely open fields, and the site of the brickworks is a light industrial park known as the \"Tramway Business Park\".\\'b\\' \\n The Connection (1973 film) \\n Synopsis \\n Frank Devlin is a popular newspaper columnist who is now out of work and in debt. A young man he knows through his regular poker game, Sy McGruder, approaches him through his wife, June. Sy was one of the robbers and now wants to sell back the jewels to the insurance company. Devlin agrees in return for ten percent of the proceeds. But Sy and his wife double-cross him. The movie ends with a high-speed chase in which Sy and his wife are apprehended. \\n Reception \\n New York Times reviewer John J. O\\\\\\'Connor wrote that the plot \"had holes wide enough to need a car chase or two\" but praised the directing by Tom Gries and the performance by Charles Durning, whose character he described as resembling Jimmy Breslin.\\'b\\' \\n Hindu titles of law \\n i. Non-payment of debts \\n Concerning the eighteen titles of law, the non-payment of debt is almost always listed first. According to Davis this is because, \"A very old practice of textual organization within and other textual genres of Sanskrit calls the first procedure or topic to be described the archetype (prakrti) and the subsequent procedures or topics the ectypes (vikrti). We saw this practice in the placement of the Brahmin as the archetype as a matter of textual concision. The Non-payment of Debts is the archetype for the other titles of law, not only because its description overlaps with and in some respects encompasses the contents of the other titles but also because debt as its thematic content pervades the subsequent titles. In terms of overlap, questions about witness, autonomy, competence, documentation, and contractual securities are all assumed in and carry over to discussions of the later titles.\" \\n ii. Deposits \\n The Sanskrit word for deposits is the words upanidhi and are synonyms. Manu VIII 179 holds that deposits should be entrusted to those who have good dharma. The person who holds the deposit typically does not receive any person benefit from doing so. The misappropriation or misplacement of a deposit due to negligence is regarded as very sinful. \"The idea is that no one is bound to accept a deposit, but when a person accepts it, his primary duty is to preserve it with care and the next duty is to return it at the time agreed or on demand. The obligation arises from the trust reposed in a person.\" \\n iii. Sale without ownership \\n is concerned with the resumption of a gift. The \"defines it as that title where a man desires to resume what has been given by him because it has been improperly given by him\". In the History of the Vol. III, P.V. Kane states, \"According to the VII. 1 and the of  when a person, who holds an open deposit, a sealed deposit, an article bailed for delivery to another, stolen property, an article borrowed for some festival, a pledge, or property lost by a stranger and found (by him), sells it in secret (or behind the back of the owner) it is to be considered as a sale by one who is not the rightful owner.\"  That which may be given must be absolutely one\\\\\\'s own with the exception of things that are required for the maintenance of one\\\\\\'s family. \\n Types of sale without ownership \\n A sale by a non-owner is known as There are two different types of sales without ownership: and vikrayah. The first, occurs when the unauthorized possessor admits to being a non-owner. The second, vikrayah occurs when the possessor does not admit to being a non-owner. The first types of sale is resolved without dispute because the possessor returns the possession to the rightful owner. The second type of sale results in a case because the possessor, although not the true owner, has sold, given, or pledged the property to a third party. In the case of the second type of sale \"the entire process of the court has to be gone through with both parties leading evidence to buttress their respective claims, and the court then giving its judgement.\"  It is seen as important that there is a first category of sale without ownership because it hints at the how \"the state was involved in the settlement of people\\\\\\'s disputes at an informal level.\" \\n Liability of an innocent buyer \\n An innocent buyer is regarded as one who does not know that what he has purchased was sold by someone without ownership.  who heavily relies on Manu and holds that \"a buyer who makes his purchase from the open market, and in the full knowledge of king\\\\\\'s men will get a clear title to the goods so purchased irrespective of the bona fides of the seller.\"  refutes this and goes so far as to say that \"not even a hundred citations of rules can confer ownership rights upon the buyer who buys from a non-owner. agrees with only insofar as the true owner fails to identify his property. \\n iv. Partnerships \\n Partnerships in Hindu law are any venture that results in two or more people working together. The have a lot to say about the different kinds of partnerships, whom one should enter into a partnership with, and rules for governing partnerships with respect to profits, losses, and quarrels among partners. For example, the of states regarding potential partners, \"that a man should carry on a joint business with other persons of good family, that are clever, active, intelligent (or educated), familiar with cons, skilled in controlling (expenditure) and income, honest and valiant (or enterprising) and that joint undertakings like trade should not be carried on by prudent men with persons (partners) who are weak or lazy or afflicted with disease or are unlucky or destitute (of money).\"  Kane states, \"It is interesting to note that the ancient Dharmasutras of Gautama, and are silent about partnerships, and that Manu  lay down rules about the distribution of fees among the priests at a sacrifice ad that in one verse  he remarks that the same principles are to be applied in all matters where men work conjointly.\" \\n v. Delivery and non-delivery of gifts \\n Non-delivery or resumption of gift is referred to as \"dattanapakarma\" in the The divides the title into four categories, \"what may be given, what may not be given, what are valid gifts, and what are invalid gifts.\" The of as reconstructed by P.V. Kane, is useful in elaborating and giving insight to this title of law. It states regarding invalid gifts, \"These cannot be given either because they are not one\\\\\\'s absolute property or because the gift of them is forbidden by the sages. In the case of even those who hold that one has ownership over one\\\\\\'s son or wife, the gift of them is not possible because it is forbidden, just as though one owns rice, yavas and masa beans, one cannot make offerings of masa because the veda prohibits their use.\" \\n vi. Non-payment of wages \\n is the Sanskrit word for the non payment of wages. The early concern themselves in large part with the payment of wages to workers. The is popularly cited by many medieval authors asserting that \"a worker shall not do even the slightest mischief to the master; if he does he loses his wages and proceedings begin.\" Mathur contends that has made it clear that this verse has reference to proceedings in a court. He says that when a worker is defeated he loses his wages in proportion to the damage caused to his master.\"  switches the order in which litigation and losing wages occurs. \\n vii. Breach of contract \\n The law of contracts is hugely concerned with the contract of debt, of pledge or mortgage, of bailments, of sale, of partnership, and of hire and service. The law of contracts is not found in one place. The do not lay down a general code of rules applicable to all transfers of immovable property, nor do they treat of transfers by way of sale, mortgage or gift in separate sections.\"   Ancient writers largely commented on who was competent to enter into transactions. Those who are \"dependent, minors, extremely old, charged with grave sins, devoid of a limb, and those that are addicted to vices\" are considered incompetent and agreements with these people are invalid. holds that any contract made under the influence of intoxicants or wrath are invalid as well as those made when a person is distressed or has an unsound mind. Manu reinforces this by stating that all contracts entered into by force are invalid. Contracts that are contrary to the kings orders are regarded as invalid. According to the king has the power to outlaw any agreements that are against and or tainted by greed. \\n viii. Cancellation of a sale or purchase \\n The deals with the cancellation of a sale or purchase. \"The principle rule is that the buyer or the seller may rescind the deal within ten days if he feels dissatisfied. But anyone forcing the other party to rescind it shall be punished.\"  The identifies the liability of the seller in case of a cancellation of a sale by the seller dependent on whether there is a price difference in a product. \"When the price goes down the seller will have to compensate the buyer as prescribed by where the price rises, and the buyer is likely to earn an extra profit, the liability of the seller is not extinguished, and he has to pay the buyer the value of the benefit, or the usufruct as the case may be. However, if the price remains unchanged the seller still has to pay interest at the rate of five percent per annum on the amount paid by the buyer.\" \\n ix. Disputes between owners and herdsman \\n In ancient times India was a predominately agricultural society and therefore was a major basis of litigation. is the Sanskrit word that refers to the disputes between the owner of cattle and the herdsman who tends to them. According to P.V. Kane \"during the day the responsibility for the safety of the cattle rests on the herdsman and during the night on the owner provided they are in the latter\\\\\\'s house.\"  The herdsman is liable for cattle if he does not attempt to save them or if he neglects them. Kane also states that \"it is the duty of the cowherd to struggle as much as in him lies to protect the cows from accidents and if he is unable to do so he must quickly inform the owner.\"  If a herdsman does not struggle to save the or protect the animals he is responsible for making good the value of the animals lost and for paying a fine of 12 panas to the king. The herdsman is also responsible if the animal dies or is lost by theft. However, if after the theft of an animal the herdsman immediately notifies the owner he is not responsible. The herdsman\\\\\\'s responsibility is also voided if he is seized, the village is attacked, or the country is invaded. \\n x. Boundary disputes \\n Boundary disputes are called or disputes relating to fields. In the the section titled Sima Vivadah deals with the determination of boundaries of fields, homes and villages. The defines boundary disputes as, \"dispute with regard to land in which questions about dikes or embankments, the boundaries of fields, ploughed land and fallow land.\". There are six causes of boundary dispute in most of the sastras, and the of states them as: \"claiming more land, claim that a person is entitled to less than he possesses, claim to a share, denial of a share, seizing possession when previously there was none, and boundary.\" \\n xi. Verbal assault \\n P.V. Kane states, steya, strisangrahana, and are five titles out of 18 that are concerned with what may be called criminal matters or crimes in modern nomenclature.\" They represent, respectively, abuse and defamation, assault, theft, adultery or unlawful intercourse with a woman, and violence. The says is defined as, \"abusive words that loudly proclaim censure of another\\\\\\'s country, caste, family and the like and that cause mental pain or offence to that man.\" The further defines three kinds of defamation, (reproachful such as calling a man a fool or a rogue), (obscene or insulting), and (mercilessly severe such as charging a man with such grave sins as or drinking liquor) and that each punishment for each later one is more severe that for each preceding one.\" \\n xii. Physical assault \\n To define or assault, the begins by saying assault, \"comprises touching, threatening to strike and actually striking another.\" Going slightly further, \"The XVIII. defines it as injuring the limbs of another with the hand, foot, weapon or other means (such as stones) or defiling or causing pain by (bringing) ashes and similar substances in contact with may be one of three kinds viz. mild, middling and highly punishable.\"  It is even explained in the that causing injury to animals and trees would fall under this category. Manu contends that the punishment should be commensurate with that of the harm caused to the victim. \\n xiii. Theft \\n Theft, or streya, is defined by the as \"depriving a man of his wealth either clandestinely or openly and either by night or by day.\"  The defines theft as, \"derivation of wealth by various means from people that are asleep, careless or intoxicated.\" Like assault, there are varying degrees of theft depending on what was stolen. The three kinds are: \"trifling (when earthen-ware, seats, cots, wood, hides, grass, beans in pods or cooked food is stolen), middling (when the theft relates to clothes except silken ones, animals except cows and bulls, metals except gold, rice and barley), and grave or high (when gold jewels, silken cloth, women, men, cattle, elephants, horses, and the wealth of or temples is stolen).\" There are several texts that agree on the definition of a thief including the and the of Their definition contends that, \"thieves are traders who employ false weights and balances, gamblers, quacks, bribers of sabhyas, prostitutes, those who profess to arbitrate, those who manufacture imitation articles, those who subsist by prognosticating good fortune or portents or by magic or palmistry, false witnesses, etc.\" \\n xv. Sexual crimes against women \\n Vas. 28. 2-3 states that, \"when a woman is polluted by being raped or kidnapped by a thief, she should not be abandoned; one should wait till her monthly illness (making her undergo certain expiations till then) and she becomes pure after it.\"  The liberally states that a woman who is raped is innocent while a man who commits rape should be put to death. Other texts are harsher, such as those of the late writer Devala, that states that women who are raped and conceive may not be restored to social intercourse even after undergoing expiation. \\n xvii. Partition of inheritance \\n The principle holds that after the death of one property owner the other is entitled to the property. After the death of a husband a wife succeeds all of the husband\\\\\\'s estate without allotting any shares for their sons. Upon the death of both parents sons are to divide ancestral estate and paternal debt equally. Partitioning during a mother\\\\\\'s lifetime is only allowed with the mother\\\\\\'s consent. \"Traces of this rule are to be found even in IX-104 of the Manu Smrti which can be literally rendered as: brothers may take equally the ancestral wealth after the mother and the father; they have no competence so long as the mother and the father are alive\" \\n xviii. Gambling and betting \\n known as \\\\\\'gambling and betting games,\\\\\\' is a traditional title of dispute first present in the earlier with little change in the post period. The is one of the only texts that presents a change, defining gambling as \"any transaction involving betting with stake money\" thus expanding the definition beyond games like dice and cockfighting.   According to Mathur, Manu\\\\\\'s categorical command to the kings to completely prohibit all gambling influences many texts like the and the These texts reflect no desirability in having any law allowing gambling. However, there are other texts like the that find gambling law to be beneficial for purposes of taxation and to provide ease in the search for criminals.\\'b\" \\n Faust (Spohr) \\n Performance history \\n Spohr had left his court appointment at Gotha and taken up a post in Vienna at the Theater An der Wien, which had recently been purchased by Count Ferdinand Palffy von He composed the opera in less than four months, May to September 1813 but had difficulties with count Palffy that interfered with getting it staged in Vienna. Though he took the manuscript score privately to Giacomo Meyerbeer, who played it, with Spohr supplementing his vocal range by it was not until Carl Maria von Weber took an interest in the score that it received its premiere. Weber conducted the first performance of Faust at the Prague on 1 September 1816. Meyerbeer introduced it at Berlin. In its original form, the opera was a Singspiel in two acts. In 1851, Spohr turned the piece into a grand opera in three acts, replacing the spoken dialogue with recitative. This version (in an Italian translation) received its premiere at the Royal Italian Opera, Covent Garden, London on 15 July 1852. A performance was given by the University College Opera at the Bloomsbury Theatre in February 1984. In 1993 the Bielefeld Opera also performed this form of Faust in what was claimed to be the first staged production worldwide since 1931. Conducted by Geoffrey Moull and directed by Matthias Oldag, the opera was given 8 performances and subsequently recorded for CPO. \\n Synopsis \\n Faust is torn between his love for the young and his desire for Kunigunde, the of Count Hugo. He makes a pact with the devil Mefistofeles which allows him to rescue Kunigunde from the clutches of the evil knight Gulf. Faust obtains a love potion from the witch Sycorax which he gives to Kunigunde during her wedding celebrations. Outraged at the sudden passion his bride shows for Faust, Count Hugo challenges him to a duel. Faust kills Hugo and flees. Meanwhile, Faust\\'s first love, drowns herself in despair. Mefistofeles seizes Faust and drags him down to Hell.\"b\\' \\n 2007 Australian GT Championship \\n Points system \\n For Rounds 1, 2, 4, 5, 6 and 7, points were awarded on a 38-32-28-25-23-21-19-18-17-16-15-14-13-12-11-10-9-8-7-6-5-4-3-2-1 basis for the top 25 positions in each of the three races.

Three bonus points were allocated for pole position at each of the eight rounds. The total for each driver was adjusted by deducting the worst round point score of those rounds which were contested. This resulted in drivers scoring zero nett points if they only contested only one round.\\'b\\' \\n Table of years in poetry \\n 2000s in poetry \\n 2000   2001   2002   2003   2004   2005   2006   2007   20082009   2010   2011   2012   2013   2014   2015   2016   2017   2018 \\n 1900s in poetry \\n 1900   1901   1902   1903   1904   1905   1906   1907   1908   19091910   1911   1912   1913   1914   1915   1916   1917   1918   1919 1920   1921   1922   1923   1924   1925   1926   1927   1928   19291930   1931   1932   1933   1934   1935   1936   1937   1938   1939 1940   1941   1942   1943   1944   1945   1946   1947   1948   19491950   1951   1952   1953   1954   1955   1956   1957   1958   1959 1960   1961   1962   1963   1964   1965   1966   1967   1968   19691970   1971   1972   1973   1974   1975   1976   1977   1978   1979 1980   1981   1982   1983   1984   1985   1986   1987   1988   19891990   1991   1992   1993   1994   1995   1996   1997   1998   1999 \\n 1800s in poetry \\n 1800   1801   1802   1803   1804   1805   1806   1807   1808   18091810   1811   1812   1813   1814   1815   1816   1817   1818   1819 1820   1821   1822   1823   1824   1825   1826   1827   1828   18291830   1831   1832   1833   1834   1835   1836   1837   1838   1839 1840   1841   1842   1843   1844   1845   1846   1847   1848   18491850   1851   1852   1853   1854   1855   1856   1857   1858   1859 1860   1861   1862   1863   1864   1865   1866   1867   1868   18691870   1871   1872   1873   1874   1875   1876   1877   1878   1879 1880   1881   1882   1883   1884   1885   1886   1887   1888   18891890   1891   1892   1893   1894   1895   1896   1897   1898   1899 \\n 1700s in poetry \\n 1700   1701   1702   1703   1704   1705   1706   1707   1708   17091710   1711   1712   1713   1714   1715   1716   1717   1718   1719 1720   1721   1722   1723   1724   1725   1726   1727   1728   17291730   1731   1732   1733   1734   1735   1736   1737   1738   1739 1740   1741   1742   1743   1744   1745   1746   1747   1748   17491750   1751   1752   1753   1754   1755   1756   1757   1758   1759 1760   1761   1762   1763   1764   1765   1766   1767   1768   17691770   1771   1772   1773   1774   1775   1776   1777   1778   1779 1780   1781   1782   1783   1784   1785   1786   1787   1788   17891790   1791   1792   1793   1794   1795   1796   1797   1798   1799 \\n 1600s in poetry \\n 1600   1601   1602   1603   1604   1605   1606   1607   1608   16091610   1611   1612   1613   1614   1615   1616   1617   1618   1619 1620   1621   1622   1623   1624   1625   1626   1627   1628   16291630   1631   1632   1633   1634   1635   1636   1637   1638   1639 1640   1641   1642   1643   1644   1645   1646   1647   1648   16491650   1651   1652   1653   1654   1655   1656   1657   1658   1659 1660   1661   1662   1663   1664   1665   1666   1667   1668   16691670   1671   1672   1673   1674   1675   1676   1677   1678   1679 1680   1681   1682   1683   1684   1685   1686   1687   1688   16891690   1691   1692   1693   1694   1695   1696   1697   1698   1699 \\n 1500s in poetry \\n 1500   1501   1502   1503   1504   1505   1506   1507   1508   15091510   1511   1512   1513   1514   1515   1516   1517   1518   1519 1520   1521   1522   1523   1524   1525   1526   1527   1528   15291530   1531   1532   1533   1534   1535   1536   1537   1538   1539 1540   1541   1542   1543   1544   1545   1546   1547   1548   15491550   1551   1552   1553   1554   1555   1556   1557   1558   1559 1560   1561   1562   1563   1564   1565   1566   1567   1568   15691570   1571   1572   1573   1574   1575   1576   1577   1578   1579 1580   1581   1582   1583   1584   1585   1586   1587   1588   15891590   1591   1592   1593   1594   1595   1596   1597   1598   1599 \\n 1400s in poetry \\n 1400s - 1410s - 1420s - 1430s - 1440s - 1450s - 1460s - 1470s - 1480s - 1490s \\n 1300s in poetry \\n 1300s - 1310s - 1320s - 1330s - 1340s - 1350s - 1360s - 1370s - 1380s - 1390s\\'b\\' \\n Bob Wright (Scottish footballer) \\n Career \\n \"Bob\" Wright played locally for Horden Colliery Welfare.

However, some advanced racers will use EGT gauges in combination with a wideband oxygen sensor to \\'lean\\' the fuel ratio a bit to safely raise the temperature for more power. \\n Advanced tuning \\n Though by tuning primarily by EGT and air fuel ratio values, EGT is still to this day a used data output for engine tuning. When fine tuning an engine, if possible with the ECU manipulation with the cylinder\\'s timing can be made. By adjusting the timing, the resultant cylinder temperature can be used to improve cylinder efficiency. Though this is still widely done, EGT values should be used as a safe guard sensor measure and as a tuning guide.

It is located in the Central Volcanic Zone and is part of the Paleocene-Eocene volcanic belt. The caldera is located 50 kilometres southwest of Copiapo.  It is heavily eroded. Active during the Cretaceous, it is a large caldera. Post-collapse activity generated subsidiary calderas inside the older main caldera. \\n Geology \\n The caldera has dimensions of 58 by 32 kilometres with a north-northeast axis. The caldera has a surface area of 1,400 square kilometres bounded by the Quebrada San Miguel to the north and Lomas Bayas in the south. Two fault zones La Ternera and San Antonio cut the caldera. Inside the caldera 3,000 metres thick layers of lava, pyroclastic flows and sediments. A pluton, Cabeza de Vaca, lies in the southern and eastern sectors of the caldera and has dimensions of 52 by kilometres Within the caldera several smaller calderas formed, from north to south Caldera Cerro Puquios, Caldera Bellavista, Caldera Agua Nueva, Caldera El Durazno and Caldera Lomas Bayas. The Puquios caldera partly overlaps the Carrizalillo caldera margin. These subsidiary calderas have left lava conduits, lacustrine and intrusive structures and other geomorphologic features. The caldera is constructed in the terrain of the San Antonio formation, which forms megabreccia in the caldera. \\n Subsidiary calderas \\n The Lomas Bayas caldera (diameter 13 kilometres cuts into the pre-main caldera basement. 400 metres of pumice and breccia lie in the caldera and 80 metres of lacustrine deposits. 150 metres thick pyroclastic flows from Caldera Durazno entered the Lomas Bayas caldera. The Caldera Durazno is a 12 kilometres wide semicircle that is filled by eruption-associated pyroclastics and postcaldera lava flows. The Caldera Agua Nueva lies northeast of Durazno and is filled with a 50 metres thick post-Carrizalillo ignimbrites. The Bellavista caldera is similar to the other calderas and also forms an arc with a diameter of 12 kilometres Trachyandesitic banks lie on its western margin, and in the caldera lies a deposit of welded pumice 600 metres thick. It contains lithic fragments including monzonite, likely formed from blocks sagging into the caldera. \\n Eruption history \\n The Hornitos basin is the precursor of the caldera, and the Lavas de Sierra La Dichosa form a precaldera stage. During the Cretaceous-Paleocene a group of stratovolcanoes formed in the area. Their eruption products are basalt and trachybasalt containing olivine and pyroxene. Magmatic intrusion triggered the formation of ring faults which then allowed the eruption of pyroclastic flows during caldera collapse. After the collapse, dacitic lava flows in the central sector of the caldera form the first postcollapse volcanism. Reestablishment of the volcanic system was strong enough to form another sequence, 1,100 metres thick, of pumice and pyroclastics, possibly the consequence of another caldera collapse. The Cabeza de Vaca pluton formed within the caldera, using the western caldera rim and the annular fracture. Activity occurred in the Paleocene-Eocene, with the pluton dated 63-59.8 mya. The subsidiary calderas are dated 48-56 mya. \\n Petrology \\n Rhyolitic pyroclastic flows were erupted during the caldera collapse. They contain devitrified fiammes and lack lithic fragments. The lack of fragments and the overall homogeneity indicates that the deposits were placed in short succession. Postcaldera flows are dacites which that are derived from the deeper portions of the magma chamber. Cabeza de Vaca contains granodiorite, granite and monzonite as well as tourmaline breccias containing Cu-Au minerals. The Lomas Bayas-El Durazno mining district is associated with the caldera.\\'b\\' \\n Michael Bethke \\n Press coverage \\n A story regarding Bethke can be found in the May 21, 1993 issue of the Chicago Tribune at page 3. The story states that Michael Bethke of Calumet City, Illinois was found not guilty by reason of insanity in the slaying of 49 year-old Joseph Lesinski and that a hearing regarding his mental condition and future prognosis would be held on June 3, 1993. The story also states that the slaying occurred on June 6, 1991, while both Bethke and his victim Lesinki were working at the Burnham White Hen Pantry. According to the story, \"Bethke admitted to decapitating Lesinski with a knife when the victim bent over to get a pack of cigarettes.\" The July 9, 1993 issue of the Tribune reports that Bethke was ordered to spend up to 49 years in a state mental institution.  The June 7, 1991, issue of the Chicago Tribune also has a detailed article on page 1. There are several other stories to be found in the Chicago Tribune and the Chicago Sun-Times. Bethke was described by Assistant Public Defender Paul Brownlee as suffering from \"chronic paranoid schizophrenia\". He used a 14-inch kitchen knife to behead Lesinski. A detailed report of the crime scene can be found in the June 8, 1991, issue of the Sun-Times, at page 12, which noted that the victim apparently had the word \"repent\" scrawled on his forehead. \\n In popular culture \\n His story was described in the song \"White Hen Decapitator\" on the Macabre album Sinister Slaughter in 1993.\\'b\" \\n Sebastian Seidl \\n Sebastian Seidl (born 12 July 1990 in is a German judoka.

Charman alleged that the book libelled him by \"suggesting that there were \\\\\\'cogent grounds\\\\\\' of suspecting him of being involved in corruption.\" In seeking to have Charman\\\\\\'s claim for damages dismissed, the author and publisher cited the \"Reynolds defence\" of qualified privilege, which protected publication of an allegation if it was made in the public interest and satisfied the test of responsible journalism. In June 2006, at the High Court of Justice of England and Wales, Mr Justice Grey ruled that the book \"did not pass all the necessary tests of \"responsible journalism\" and was not entitled to protection\" of qualified privilege. Following the reaffirmation of the Reynolds defence in Jameel v Wall Street Journal Europe Sprl in October 2006, in which the Law Lords sitting in the House of Lords determined that libel judges in the lower courts had been interpreting the criteria too strictly, McLagan and Orion appealed their case. On 11 October 2007, Lord Justice Ward, Lord Justice Sedley and Lord Justice Hooper, sitting in the Court of Appeal of England and Wales, allowed the appeal and dismissed Charman\\\\\\'s claim for first time that the Reynolds defence had succeeded in the publication of a book. In their ruling, the judges said they were satisfied that the book was a piece of responsible journalism, that McLagan had taken steps to verify the story and that \"as a result of his honesty, his expertise on the subject, his careful research and his painstaking evaluation of a mass of material, the book was protected.\" Caroline Kean, McLagan\\\\\\'s solicitor, called the ruling \"ground-breaking and momentous\", and said: \"This is an unambiguous confirmation by the Court of Appeal that Reynolds is alive and kicking. It is not limited to newspapers, it means all media and there is no time constraint. It applies equally to a book and, by analogy, it will apply to a film or a TV programme, providing it is something of proper public interest and a journalist has done his very best to act in the course of responsible journalism.\"\\'b\\' \\n Green Party of Minnesota \\n History \\n The Minnesota Greens Confederation, founded c. 1990/91, fostered the development of local Green Party organizations in the state. The Green Party of Minnesota was organized in December 1993. It was officially established in February and June 1994 at two founding conventions. Twin Cities Greens was organized in 1988. The Green Party of St. Paul was established in 1997 to 1998. The Green Party of Minnesota was founded in 1994 on the Four Pillars of the Green Party: Ecological Wisdom, Social and Economic Justice, Grassroots Democracy, and Nonviolence and Peace. In the 2000 Presidential Election, Green Party Presidential nominee Ralph Nader and Vice Presidential nominee Winona LaDuke received 5% of the vote in Minnesota, which earned major party status for the Green Party in Minnesota. But in the election of 2004, neither Green Party presidential nominee David Cobb nor any candidate for statewide office received 5% or more, thus losing major party status in the state. In 2003 Elaine Fleming became the first elected Green mayor in Minnesota. Fleming is mayor of Cass Lake, Minnesota, and was elected mayor for her first term by seven votes. Fleming was elected mayor for a second term as a write-in candidate. As of 2006, Fleming was serving her second and last term as Mayor. While the party is currently defined as a minor political party, it has had recent success in some city elections, especially in Minneapolis and St. Paul. In 2005, Cam Gordon, a former chair of the Green Party of Minnesota, was elected in Ward 2 to the Minneapolis City Council, winning over DFLer Cara Letofsky in a 51% to 48% vote. Ward 2 is considered one of the most diverse areas of Minneapolis, representing the University of Minnesota Minneapolis Campus and the Cedar-Riverside and Seward neighborhoods. Despite this gain on the council, two Green incumbents on the council, Natalie Johnson Lee (Ward 6) and Dean Zimmermann (Ward 7), were unseated during the 2005 election. Redistricting had pitted both against other council incumbents. While initially elected as a Democrat in 1986 to the Minneapolis Park Board, Annie Young ran as a Green from her third term on, becoming one of the longest serving Park Board Commissioners in Minneapolis history. In 2009 Cam Gordon was re-elected to Minneapolis City Council. In 2011 Green Party endorsed Laura Libby was elected to the Section 1 seat of the City Council of Crystal, Minnesota. Cam Gordon was elected to a third term on the Minneapolis City Council in 2013. In 2014 the Green Party of Minnesota ran former DFL State Representative Andy Dawkins for Attorney General receiving 1.49% of the vote statewide and regaining minor party status. Despite restrictive Minnesota ballot access laws, volunteers collected three times the required signatures to place Green endorsed Presidential candidate Dr Jill Stein on the ballot in 2016. Minnesota Secretary of State Steve Simon refused to replace the ballot petitions stand-in Vice Presidential candidate Howie Hawkins with Ajamu Baraka, the only candidate of color in the race, despite no law denying his ability to do so. Dr Jill Stein went on to receive 1.26% of the vote statewide double the Green Presidential vote from 2012 and again securing minor party status for the Green Party of Minnesota until 2020. Three additional Greens were elected in 2016, including the first elected Green in Ramsey County history Lena Buggs winning a seat on the Ramsey County Soil & Water District Board unseating the incumbent. In Anoka County, Greens Sharon Lemay and Steve Laitinen were both elected to the Anoka County Soil and Water District Board as well. \\n Platform \\n The Green Vision of the Green Party Minnesota is as follows: Green political philosophy is inspired by four basic values: Ecology, Nonviolence, Social and Economic Justice, and Grassroots Democracy. Fundamentally, we believe human beings should understand themselves as part of a living planet, rather than attempting to dominate and exploit it, or each other. We seek to return to our original ideal government of, by, and for the people by empowering all of our citizens through direct, grassroots democracy. We envision a world where people can live fulfilled lives by achieving their personal destiny as a contributing member of a living planet. We envision the revitalization of culture and human interaction that can occur in communities of people living close together who play together, work together, share sorrows and joys together and care about the well-being of their neighbors. We envision each community applying human-scale technologies in their workplaces and having a diversified base of businesses, which supply many of the product and service needs of that community. We envision each community having a strong level of control over community affairs and over businesses within its boundaries. We envision national and regional governments which are truly democratically-controlled and which take true leadership in protecting the environment, bringing peace to the world, alleviating human suffering and promoting human development. \\n Leadership \\n The party is led by a 17-member coordinating committee which sets the party\\\\\\'s long-range goals, budget, and strategy. These decisions are then implemented by an executive committee made of five party co-chairs, each of whom is responsible for one of five portfolios of party business (membership, political affairs, finances, communications, and internal organization). Each portfolio co-chair oversees a number of committees and party functions. While the coordinating and executive committees handle day-to-day operations of the state party, most organizing, activism, and decision-making is decentralized into a number of autonomous local party organizations (or \"seedlings\") located throughout the state.\\'b\" \\n Demba (politician) \\n Background \\n has been a member of the Transnational Transparty Nonviolent Radical Party since 2002.

Edward Marsden (1869-1932) was a Canadian-American missionary and member of the Tsimshian nation who became the first Alaska Native to be ordained in the ministry. \\n Early life \\n He was born May 19, 1869, in Metlakatla, British Columbia, and became from his earliest years a of that utopian Christian community\\\\\\'s founder, the charismatic Anglican lay minister William Duncan.  Edward\\\\\\'s father, Samuel Marsden, had been one of Duncan\\\\\\'s first converts and was named after a famed Anglican missionary.  Edward\\\\\\'s mother was Catherine Kitlahn, Duncan\\\\\\'s housekeeper.  Duncan tutored young Edward in reading, music, and eventually bookkeeping and business.  As a teenager, Marsden was one of the approximately 800 Tsimshians who undertook an epic canoe voyage in 1887 to found Duncan\\\\\\'s new, dissident community of \"New Metlakatla\" on Annette Island in the very southeast of Alaska. Duncan exercised fierce control over his parishioners\\\\\\' lives and for a while barred the young, ambitious Marsden from leaving the island to pursue higher education.  Eventually, the Presbyterian missionary Sheldon Jackson intervened and persuaded Duncan to let Marsden join him in Sitka, Alaska, to attend the industrial school there (now known as Sheldon Jackson College). There he became Jackson\\\\\\'s own earning high marks, learning to preach, and gradually shifting from Duncan\\\\\\'s low-church Anglicanism towards conversion to Presbyterianism. Jackson arranged for Marsden to attend the Carlisle Indian School in Pennsylvania and then Marietta College in Ohio, making him the first Alaska Native to receive higher education in the \"lower 48.\"  During his education there, he joined the Presbyterian Church, deepening his schism with Duncan. In 1894 he became a U.S. citizen, the first Alaska Native to do so. He attended Lane Theological Seminary in Cincinnati, Ohio, from which he graduated in 1898, becoming ordained the same year. Also, in 1897 he became the first North American Indian to be licensed to preach in the U.S. \\n Career \\n Duncan refused to find a position for Marsden in Metlakatla, and was especially opposed to Marsden\\\\\\'s suggestion that a Presbyterian church be established on Annette Island to minister to the Tlingit families on the island. The island was (and is) still the unceded territory of the Tongass tribe of Tlingit, who were then, as now, a predominantly Presbyterian people. Instead, under Jackson\\\\\\'s direction, Marsden was installed as minister at the Tlingit community of Saxman, near Ketchikan. The establishment of that mission consolidated that community\\\\\\'s position as a gathering place for various Tlingit subgroups of the area.  From here he participated in a fierce rivalry with Duncan for Tsimshian loyalties, including participating in a campaign to have Duncan removed by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA).  His complaints, and those of many in the community, focused on Duncan\\\\\\'s control over the community\\\\\\'s entire economic life and his opposition to his flock\\\\\\'s seeking any economic or educational betterment off of the island. Marsden married Lucy Kinninook, the young woman whose job was to translate Marsden\\\\\\'s English sermons into Tlingit. She was a Tlingit chief\\\\\\'s daughter and had been partially raised by the missionary Thomas Crosby in the Tsimshian community of Lax Kw\\\\\\'alaams (a.k.a. Port Simpson), B.C. Duncan refused to perform their marriage on the grounds that she was a Marsden was also involved in the short-lived sawmill community of Port Gravina, near Ketchikan, which was founded in 1892 and burned to the ground in 1904. This was an offshoot of the Metlakatla community, committed to Presbyterianism rather than Anglicanism and oriented to individual economic advancement outside of Duncan\\\\\\'s control. After Duncan\\\\\\'s death in 1918, Marsden was involved in the transition to new leadership, becoming a partner in running the Metlakatla Commercial Company, the community\\\\\\'s economic engine. In 1922, Marsden began construction of a Presbyterian church in Metlakatla, where he was to serve as minister until his death.  He was also a political leader in the community. \\n Death \\n In May 1932 Marsden died in Ketchikan of injuries sustained during a rough sea voyage between Metlakatla and Hydaburg, Alaska. \\n Legacy \\n A comparison of two 1955 biography of Marsden by William Gilbert Beattie, a Presbyterian BIA superintendent who had been allied with him, and on the other hand Peter Murray\\\\\\'s very pro-Duncan account of the controversies in his 1985 Duncan biography (see bibliography) -- will attest to the strong feelings that the Duncan-Marsden rivalry continue to give rise to among those with a stake in the Metlakatla community. \\n Archival Collections \\n The Presbyterian Historical Society in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, has a single letter written by Edward Marsden. In the letter, he describes the death of William Duncan and his own work in Alaska.\\'b\\' \\n Bosnia and Herzegovina \\n History \\n The city was founded by Bosnian settlers from Ottoman province of Smederevo in 1862. It was part of the Ottoman province of Bosnia by the time it was annexed by Austro-Hungarian Empire in 1887. After World War I, the city became part of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. From 1929 to 1939, it was part of Drina Banovina; and from 1939 until 1941 it was part of the Banovina of Croatia. During World War II, as all the rest of Bosnia-Herzegovina, was included into Nazi-controlled Independent State of Croatia. After 1945, the city was reintegrated within the Socialist Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina in Tito\\\\\\'s Yugoslavia. In the early stages of the Bosnian war the town was occupied by Bosnian Serbs who established the provisional municipal government. Most Bosniaks and Bosnian Croats were ethnically cleansed. During the war, a semi-permanent front line was established against Croatian and Bosniak forces towards the neighboring In 2003, three Bosnian Serb town leaders at the time of the Yugoslav Wars were sentenced in ICTY for crimes against humanity. The town lies on an important strategic position in Republika Srpska, near As with most other places under Serb control, Srpska authorities removed the \"Bosnian\" adjective from the town\\\\\\'s official name and changed it to Bosniaks and Bosnian Croats continued to refer to it by its historical name of \"Bosanski (Serbian Cyrillic: causing tension among the inhabitants.

Shay is picked at constantly, the main perpetrators being Arjun, the tall athletic sports captain and his best friend Baadal. Shay and Pia; the spunky daughter of the new Junior School history teacher, are cast as Bassanio and Portia in the Founders Day production of Merchant of Venice. But Baadal the son of a feigning movie star wants Pia and thus the role opposite her. Murali, the charismatic drama teacher unknowingly adds salt to wounds by casting him as understudy. Indignant, Baadal vows to get part at any cost and turns to his buddy Arjun, the school Sports Captain, to help him secure the role by ousting Shay. It is a battle of wit against brawn, endurance against torture, courage against disgrace. The bullies brutally victimize Shay hoping to break him so he willingly relents his role. But Shay needs this role and will not budge, no matter what they do. Events take a sinister turn when Murali notices Shay\\\\\\'s condition and intervenes to help him out. Now the whole school scorns upon him for being a RAT. Humiliated beyond repair Shay starts resenting Murali and begins to harbour a desire for revenge. This is the first step to his own undoing.... \\n Marketing and release \\n The official teaser was released on 24 May 2018. The official trailer of the film was released on 17 June 2019 by Yoodlee Films. The film was released theatrically in India on 28 June 2019. \\n Critical response \\n Siddhant Adlakha covering The New York Indian Film Festival, writing for /Film felt the premise could have made for a feel-good story in some other universe, and opined that the film expresses horrors within noble institutions that present themselves as culturally superior. He also submitted that in the guise of classy uniforms and pretension of culture superiority, men are turned into monsters, saying \"Noblemen, while largely withheld to a point of minimalism, bursts sporadically with an unsettling energy as it explores the circumstances in which monsters create more monsters.\" Roger Walker-Dack concurred with Adlakha, and said, \"The Noblemen brings home the point that in such an insidious regime where bullying still persists it is a breeding ground for even more homophobia.\" Sreeparna Sengupta of The Times of India gives the film three stars out of five, praising performance of Ali Haji, Muskaan Jaferi, Hardik Thakkar, Mohommad Ali Mir, Shaan, Kunal Kapoor and Soni Razdan, she says, \"Winter and the backdrop of mountains, makes for the perfect setting in Noblemen as an unpredictable twist and the end of innocence makes its way here.\" She opines that Noblemen deals with school bullying and presents a graphic picture of its brutality and psychological impact it leaves on the mind of victim. She feels that the film lags pace here and there but it brings to fore some important issues. Amman Khurana of Times Now rated it three stars out of five, said, \"Noblemen, engaging for the most part, is not your regular masala entertainer. [So] prepare yourself for an in-your-face cinematic experience.\" He felt that performances of ensemble were \\\\\\'top-notch\\\\\\'. Agreeing with Sengupta he opined that the \\\\\\'merciless winter\\\\\\' was a perfect setting for the film, that presented bullying, homophobia and toxic masculinity. \\n Accolades \\n Noblemen premiered at the New York Indian Film Festival and Ali Haji won the Child award.\\'b\\' \\n Meg Rosoff \\n Early life and education \\n Rosoff was born in Boston, Massachusetts in 1956, into a Jewish family; the second of four sisters.  She attended Harvard University from 1974-1977, then moved to London and studied sculpture at Saint Martin\\\\\\'s School of Art. She returned to the United States to finish her degree in 1980, and later moved to New York City for 9 years, where she worked in publishing and advertising. \\n Career \\n In 1989, at the age of 32 Rosoff returned to London and has lived there ever since. Between 1989 and 2003, she worked for a variety of advertising agencies as a copywriter.  She began to write novels after her youngest sister died of breast cancer. Her young-adult novel How I Live Now was published in 2004, in the same week she was diagnosed with breast cancer. It won the annual Guardian Children\\\\\\'s Fiction Prize, a once-in-a-lifetime book award judged by a panel of British children\\\\\\'s book writers, and the annual Michael L. Printz Award from the American Library Association, recognising the year\\\\\\'s \"best book written for teens, based entirely on its literary merit\". In 2005 she published a children\\\\\\'s book, Meet Wild Boars, which was illustrated by Sophie Blackall. Just in Case, published in 2006, won the British Carnegie Medal and German Jugendliteraturpreis. What I Was, her third novel was published in August 2007, followed by two more collaborations with Blackall:  Wild Boars Cook and Jumpy Jack and Googily. Another novel, The Bride\\\\\\'s Farewell was named one of 2009\\\\\\'s ten best books for young adults that were published in the American adult market. There Is No Dog, published by Penguin in 2011 (US edition, Putnam, 2012) is a comic novel supposing that God is a 19-year-old boy. Rosoff told Book Nerd, \"The title comes from a joke about a dyslexic atheist walking up and down in front of a church with a sign that reads THERE IS NO DOG.\" Picture Me Gone was a finalist for the 2013 National Book Award for Young People\\\\\\'s Literature (U.S.). The film of How I Live Now directed by Kevin MacDonald and starring Saoirse Ronan opened in Britain on 4 October 2013 and in America and Canada on 5 November 2013.\\'b\\' \\n Seagram Building \\n Structure \\n The 38-story structure combines a steel moment frame and a steel and reinforced concrete core for lateral stiffness. The concrete core shear walls extend up to the 17th floor, and diagonal core bracing (shear trusses) extends to the 29th floor. According to Severud Associates, the structural engineering consultants, it was the first tall building to use high strength bolted connections, the first tall building to combine a braced frame with a moment frame, one of the first tall buildings to use a vertical truss bracing system and the first tall building to employ a composite steel and concrete lateral frame. \\n Plaza \\n The Seagram Building and Lever House, which sits just across Park Avenue, set the architectural style for skyscrapers in New York City for several decades. It appears as a simple bronze box, set back from Park Avenue by a large, open granite plaza. Mies intended to create an urban open space in front of the building, despite the luxuriousness of the idea, and it became a very popular gathering area. In 1961, when New York City enacted a major revision to its 1916 Zoning Resolution, the nation\\\\\\'s first comprehensive Zoning Resolution, it offered incentives for developers to install \"privately owned public spaces\" which were meant to emulate that of the Seagram Building. The Seagram Building\\\\\\'s plaza was also the site of a landmark planning study by William H. Whyte, the American sociologist. The film, Social Life of Small Urban Spaces, produced in conjunction with the Municipal Art Society of New York, records the daily patterns of people socializing around the plaza. It shows how people actually use space, varying from the supposed intent of the architects. \\n Restaurants \\n The building was home to famed restaurants The Four Seasons, designed by the architects, and Brasserie, by Diller + Scofidio. It now hosts three restaurants, all of which are owned by Major Food Group: The Grill, The Pool, and The Lobster Club. \\n Sale \\n Joseph Seagram sold the building in 1979 to the New York City-based  Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association for $70.5 million in 1979.  It was in turn sold at the height of the new millennium real estate boom to New York City Aby Rosen for $375 million in 2000. \\n In popular culture \\n The plaza and fountains are the featured grounds in the buildup to the final scene of the 1961 film Breakfast At Tiffany\\\\\\'s,  as Paul (George Peppard) tries with all his might to win the heart of Holly (Audrey Hepburn). In the song \"Side by Side by Side\", from Stephen Sondheim\\\\\\'s musical Company, one of the characters (David) says \"You know what comes to my mind every time I see him? The Seagram\\\\\\'s Building!\" In the Richard Donner film Scrooged, Bill Murray\\\\\\'s office is in the building. In the credits of season one of That Girl, the fountains are featured prominently as Marlo Thomas walks past. The building is featured prominently in the film Baby Boom as J.C. Wyatt\\\\\\'s (Diane Keaton) office building. In Ira Levin\\\\\\'s book Rosemary\\\\\\'s Baby, Hutch asks Rosemary to meet him in front of the Seagram Building, apparently to warn her of the Castevets\\\\\\' nefarious nature. In the first scene of the 1959 film, The Best of Everything, Caroline (Hope Lange) is reading a \"Help Wanted - Female\" ad in the paper which shows the real-life address of the Seagram\\\\\\'s Building in front of which she is standing and later goes to work. The building is seen in Showtime\\\\\\'s House of Lies. The building is seen in the movie Hitch. In the poem \"Steps\" by Frank O\\\\\\'Hara, featured in his famous book of poetry Lunch Poems, the poet mentions the Seagram Building, saying that it\\\\\\'s \"no longer rivalled in interest/not that we need liquor (we just like it)\".\\'b\" \\n The Big Apple Rotten to the Core \\n Aftermath \\n The album was the first New York City hardcore punk compilation made available to college and alternative radio stations nationwide. It quickly gained notoriety, but despite its success, the album seemed to be jinxed. Demand for the record\\'s second pressing could not be met because the pressing plant would not release the masters and was bootlegging them in other parts of the country. The owner of the plant was eventually busted by the FBI for bootlegging Beatles albums. A follow-up album, The Big Apple Rotten to the Core, Vol. 2, was released five years later by the Raw Power label, and included the returning Ism, Butch Lust, The Mob and The Headlickers alongside newer bands such as Ed Gein\\'s Car, Bunker\\'s Boys, Slime Puppies and The Six and Violence. Omer Travers (infamous for breaking into Yoko Ono\\'s apartment and leaving love notes) appeared on this album with a song produced by Jism and Sallese. Travers and Jism were later invited onto The Howard Stern Show to promote the album.\"b\\' \\n War Manpower Commission \\n The War Manpower Commission was a World War II agency of the United States Government charged with planning to balance the labor needs of agriculture, industry and the armed forces. \\n History \\n The Commission was created by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in Executive Order 9139 of April 18, 1942. Its chairman was Paul V. McNutt, head of the Federal Security Agency. In this Executive Order, the War Manpower Commission was headed by the Federal Security Administrator as Chairman, and consisted of representatives from the Department of War, the Department of the Navy, the Department of Agriculture, the Department of Labor, the War Production Board, the Labor Production Division of the War Production Board, the Selective Service System, and the United States Civil Service Commission to ensure effective mobilization of manpower in the post-war era. Executive Order 9279, dated December 5, 1942, transferred the Selective Service System to the War Manpower Commission. However, a year later it was made a separate agency directly responsible to the President. McNutt appointed all men to his labor advisory committee, despite the pleas of Bureau director, Mary Anderson, to have women represented. Instead, he created a Advisory Committee appointing thirteen prominent women professionals, business executives, journalists, educators and organizational presidents. However, he did not provide a budget and its members were not paid.\\'b\\' \\n Nathaniel M. Bunker \\n Biography \\n Bunker was born on August 31, 1817 in Milan, New York. In 1885, he moved to Troy, Walworth County, Wisconsin. He died on March 25, 1889. \\n Assembly career \\n Bunker was a member of the Assembly during the 1875 session. Previously, he had been an unsuccessful candidate in 1871. He was a Republican.\\'b\\' \\n Abductive logic programming \\n Informal meaning and problem solving \\n The clauses in P define a set of non-abducible predicates and through this they provide a description (or model) of the problem domain. The integrity constraints in IC specify general properties of the problem domain that need to be respected in any solution of a problem. A problem, G, which expresses either an observation that needs to be explained or a goal that is desired, is represented by a conjunction of positive and negative (NAF) literals. Such problems are solved by computing \"abductive explanations\" of G. An abductive explanation of a problem G is a set of positive (and sometimes also negative) ground instances of the abducible predicates, such that, when these are added to the logic program P, the problem G and the integrity constraints IC both hold. Thus abductive explanations extend the logic program P by the addition of full or partial definitions of the abducible predicates. In this way, abductive explanations form solutions of the problem according to the description of the problem domain in P and IC. The extension or completion of the problem description given by the abductive explanations provides new information, hitherto not contained in the solution to the problem. Quality criteria to prefer one solution over another, often expressed via integrity constraints, can be applied to select specific abductive explanations of the problem G. Computation in ALP combines the backwards reasoning of normal logic programming (to reduce problems to sub-problems) with a kind of integrity checking to show that the abductive explanations satisfy the integrity constraints. The following two examples, written in simple structured English rather than in the strict syntax of ALP, illustrate the notion of abductive explanation in ALP and its relation to problem solving. \\n Example 1 \\n The abductive logic program, , has in  the following sentences:   Grass is wet if it rained.    Grass is wet if the sprinkler was on.    The sun was shining. The abducible predicates in  are \"it rained\" and \"the sprinkler was on\" and the only integrity constraint in  is:   false if it rained and the sun was shining. The observation that the grass is wet has two potential explanations, \"it rained\" and \"the sprinkler was on\", which entail the observation. However, only the second potential explanation, \"the sprinkler was on\", satisfies the integrity constraint. \\n Example 2 \\n Consider the abductive logic program consisting of the following (simplified) clauses:   X is a citizen if X is born in the USA.    X is a citizen if X is born outside the USA and X is a resident of the USA and X is naturalized.    X is a citizen if X is born outside the USA and Y is the mother of X and Y is a citizen and X is registered.    Mary is the mother of John.    Mary is a citizen. together with the five abducible predicates, \"is born in the USA\", \"is born outside the USA\", \"is a resident of the USA\", \"is naturalized\" and \"is registered\" and the integrity constraint:   false if John is a resident of the USA. The goal \"John is citizen\" has two abductive solutions, one of which is \"John is born in the USA\", the other of which is \"John is born outside the USA\" and \"John is registered\". The potential solution of becoming a citizen by residence and naturalization fails because it violates the integrity constraint. A more complex example that is also written in the more formal syntax of ALP is the following. \\n Implementation and systems \\n Most of the implementations of ALP extend the SLD resolution-based computational model of logic programming. ALP can also be implemented by means of its link with Answer Set Programming (ASP), where the ASP systems can be employed. Examples of systems of the former approach are ACLP, A-system, CIFF, SCIFF, ABDUAL and ProLogICA.\\'b\" \\n Galera railway station \\n Galera is the third highest railway station in the Western Hemisphere with an elevation of \\n Overview \\n It is situated in the Andes in Peru at km 172.7 on the Ferrocarril Central Andino (FCCA) line from Lima to Huancayo, immediately east of the Galera summit tunnel above sea level).

Lyrically, the song first states that Christmas lasts all the way until Easter, before mentioning that this is not the case, since the fasting season comes between them. Danish poet Mads Hansen from Vester Skerninge wrote a longer lyrics version, \"Nu har vi jul igen\". The song was recorded by the Gregg Smith Singers as \"Now it is Yule again\" in a four-part, a capella, mixed-voice chorus arrangement by Gregg Smith on their 1960 album Christmas Carols from Around the World (Crown Records CLP 5194).\\'b\\' \\n North v South (film) \\n Release \\n The film was not released to cinemas, but directly to DVD. \\n Reception \\n The film was poorly received by critics, with a review in The Guardian giving the film only two out of five stars: \"Despite its semi-interesting premise, a new take on star-crossed lovers, Steven low-budget Brit gangster flick fails to deliver\".\\'b\\' \\n S&DJR Sentinels \\n Service \\n The two locomotives were both built in 1929 and given the S&DJR numbers 101 and 102.  The locomotives replaced three older Highbridge-built saddle tanks, 24A, 25A and 45A.  They were both used for shunting coal wagons on the colliery branchlines around Radstock.  They were built to a reduced loading gauge as they had to pass under the Tyning Arch which had only clearance. They were taken into London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS) stock in 1930 and renumbered  After nationalisation in 1948, they became under British Railways.  47191 was withdrawn in 1959 from Bath Green Park and 47190 in 1961 from Bristol (Barrow Road).

Some sources hold that it was Kukuraja who prophesied the birth of Garab Dorje, the founder of the human lineage of the Nyingmapa Dzogchen Tantra teachings though the chronology is problematic. The tradition holds that there may be multiple Kukaraja\\\\\\'s which are conflated (a view also propounded by modern scholarship) or the different Kukkaraja according to Nyingma tradition may be understood as a lineage of mindstream emanations. \\n Instruction \\n According to Nyingma tradition, King Ja taught himself intuitively from \"the Book\" of the Tantric Way of Secret Mantra (that is Mantrayana) that magically fell from the sky along with other sacred objects and relics \"upon the roof of King Ja\" according to Dudjom et al. (1991: History) took place on the Tibetan calendar year of the Earth Monkey, which Dudjom  et al. identify as 853 BC[E]. Kukuraja received instruction drawn from \"the Book\" on what may be understood as the Outer Tantras from King Ja, then King Ja received instruction on what may be understood as the Inner Tantras from Kukuraja (Kukkuraja taught King Ja after Kukkuraja received a direct revelation of Vajrasattva wherein Vajrasattva prophesied the imminent esoteric transmission of Vajrapani, the Lord of Secrets, to Kukuraja which was only made possible through the quickening of Kukuraja by King Ja with his intuitive knowledge drawn from \"the Book\") as Dudjom et al. (1991: of the principally Nyingma view relates: \"Then King Ja taught the book to master Uparaja, who was renowned as a great scholar throughout the land of Sahor, but he could not understand their symbolic conventions and meaning. The king then taught them to the master Kukkuraja. He intuitively understood the chapter on the \"Vision of Vajrasattva\", from the Tantra of the Magical Net of Vajrasattva [Wylie: rdo rje sems dpa\\\\\\' sgyu \\\\\\'phrul drva ba (also known as the Guhyagarbha Tantra)], and practiced it, whereupon Vajrasattva revealed himself and predicted that the Lord of Secrets would reveal the meanings of this tantra thereafter. When he had practised more, the Lord of Secrets actually appeared and granted him [Kukkuraja] the complete empowerment of the authentic teaching and of all vehicles. Then he told him to request the verbal teaching from the Licchavi Vimalakirti. It is said that, following the transmitted precepts of the Lord of Secrets, master Kukkuraja divided [the Mahayoga tantras] into the Eighteen Great Tantrapitaka (tantra chen-po sde bco-brgyad) and taught them to King Ja.\" \\n Interpreter \\n Kukuraja interpreted Tantras for King Indrabhuti. Indrabhuti is held in some sources to be the father of Padmasambhava. \\n Nomenclature, orthography and etymology \\n Kukuraja, Kukkuraja, Kukuradza, Kukkuradza and many other permutations. \\n Indonesian or Malay Mantranaya \\n There is a Dancing Ganesha at Candi Sukuh that holds a small dog, a marked Buddhadharma motif of the Hindu deity which holds iconic salience with the narrative and motifs of the \"Dog King\", Kukuraja. This is important for identifying the date of the tantric lineage(s) that disseminated to the Indonesian archipelago, refer: Vajrayana Buddhism in Southeast Asia. Candi Sukuh  is a fifteenth-century Javanese-Hindu-Buddhist temple (candi) that demonstrates strong tantric influence. Candi Sukuh is located on the western slope of Mount Lawu (elev. or 3,000 feet above sea level) on the border between Central and East Java provinces. The monument was built around 1437, as written as a chronogram date on the western gate, meaning that the area was under the rule of the Majapahit Kingdom during its end The distinctive Dancing Ganesha relief in Candi Sukuh has a similarity with the Tantric ritual found in the history of Buddhism in Tibet written by Taranatha. The Tantric ritual is associated with several figures, one of whom is described as the \"King of Dogs\" (Sanskrit: Kukuraja), the mahasiddha who taught his disciples by day, and by night performed Ganacakra in a burial ground or charnel ground. Importantly, Ganesha also appears in Buddhism, not only in the form of the Buddhist god but also portrayed as a Hindu demon form also called  Ganesha\\\\\\'s image may be found on Buddhist sculptures of the late Gupta period.  As the Buddhist god Ganesha is often shown dancing, a form called Ganapati that was popular in North India and adopted in Nepal and then into Tibet. It is this Dancing Ganesha form which is evident in Candi Sukuh.

An ice skating accident when he was ten broke Fillmore\\\\\\'s hip and left him with lifelong disabilities.  In his early years, despite little formal education, he studied Shakespeare, Tennyson, Emerson and Lowell as well as works on spiritualism, Eastern religions, and metaphysics. He met his future wife, Mary Caroline \"Myrtle\" Page, in Denison, Texas in the mid-1870s.  After losing his job there, he moved to Gunnison, Colorado where he worked at mining and real estate. He married Myrtle in Clinton, Missouri on  March 29, 1881 and the newlyweds moved to Pueblo, Colorado, where Charles established a real estate business with the brother-in-law of Nona Lovell Brooks, who was later to found the Church of Divine Science. \\n Introduction to New Thought \\n After the births of their first two sons, Lowell Page Fillmore and Waldo Rickert Fillmore, the family moved to Kansas City, Missouri. Two years later, in 1886, Charles and Myrtle attended New Thought classes held by Dr. E. B. Weeks.  Myrtle subsequently recovered from chronic tuberculosis and attributed her recovery to her use of prayer and other methods learned in Weeks\\\\\\' classes. Subsequently, Charles began to heal from his childhood accident, a development which he too attributed to following this philosophy. Charles Fillmore became a devoted student of philosophy and religion. In 1889, Charles  and Myrtle began publication of a new periodical, \\\\\\'Modern Thought\\\\\\', notable among other things as the first publication to accept for publication the writings of the then 27-year-old New Thought pioneer William Walker Atkinson.  In 1890, they announced a prayer group that would later be called \\\\\\'Silent Unity\\\\\\'. In 1891, Fillmore\\\\\\'s \\\\\\'Unity\\\\\\' magazine was first published. Dr. H. Emilie Cady published \\\\\\'Lessons in Truth\\\\\\' in the new magazine. This material later was compiled and published in a book by the same name, which served as a seminal work of the Unity Church. Although Charles had no intention of making Unity into a denomination, his students wanted a more organized group. He and his wife were among the first ordained Unity ministers in 1906. Charles and Myrtle Fillmore operated the Unity organizations from a campus near downtown Kansas City. \\n Death \\n Myrtle Fillmore died in 1931. Charles remarried in 1933 to Cora G. Dedrick who was a collaborator on his later writings.  Charles Fillmore died in 1948.  Unity continued, growing into a worldwide movement; Unity World Headquarters at Unity Village and Unity Worldwide Ministries are the organizations of the movement. \\n Tenets and Beliefs \\n In a pamphlet called \"Answers to Your Questions About Unity\", poet James Dillet Freeman says that Charles and Myrtle both had health problems and turned to some new ideas which they believed helped to improve these problems.  Their beliefs are centered on two basic propositions: (1) God is good. (2) God is available; in fact, God is in you. The pamphlet goes on to say that: About a year after the Fillmores started the magazine Modern Thought, they had the inspiration that if God is what they thought - the principle of love and intelligence, the source of all good - God is wherever needed. It was not necessary for people to be in the same room with them in order for them to unite in thought and prayer. In his later years, Fillmore felt so young that he thought that he might be physically immortal, as well as believing that he might be the reincarnation of Paul of Tarsus. Charles and Myrtle Fillmore were vegetarians.\\'b\" \\n Reel Corporation \\n History \\n Reel Corporation distributes many films, children programmes and television series.  It also deals with independent studio film content titles which would receive limited release in cinemas. While instead Village Roadshow would release big blockbusters from studios such as Warner Bros. and New Line Cinema. Reel Corporation would look after genre titles which didn\\'t necessarily have big studio output deals, which aided in international distribution for films which include Teaching Mrs. Tingle and Bride of Chucky. \\n Revival \\n Starting in February 2007, Village Roadshow allocated many of its \\'smaller\\' titles to Reel DVD to be repackaged and re-distributed, and sold at discount prices. These also included big budget films like Jason X and The Art of War which hadn\\'t achieved high sales on DVD. They were submitted for Revision at the Office of Film and Literature Classification (Australia\\'s censorship board) and officially given new Classification logos and simpler Classification Advice. Reel continues to distribute small-scale and direct-to-DVD films. They are also subject to releasing popular titles that sold well but not much.\"b\" \\n Flomena Chepchirchir \\n Flomena Chepchirchir (born 1 December 1981) is a Kenyan long-distance runner who competes in half marathon and marathon events. Chepchirchir has won half marathons in Venlo, Glasgow and Zwolle. She is a two-time winner of the BIG 25 Berlin race. She has a half marathon best of 1:08:22 hours and a marathon best of 2:23:00 hours. \\n Biography \\n Chepchirchir was born in Embu, in Kenya\\'s Eastern Province. One of her earliest wins came at the Cursa de Bombers in 2002, where she won the 10K race in a time of 33:10 minutes. She won the 10K section of the cross country race a year later. Chepchirchir began to establish herself in Europe around 2006. That year she came fourth at the Glasgow Half Marathon with a time of 1:11:30 hours, won the Maastrichts Mooiste 15K and came first in the half marathon section of the Drenthe Marathon. In 2007, she came second at the Hamburg 10K, won the Utrecht Half Marathon in a personal best of 1:10:44 hours and set a 25K best of 1:25:38 hours to win the BIG 25 Berlin. Later that season she came fourth at the Dam tot Damloop 10-miler. Chepchirchir won both the Venloop and Zwolle Half Marathons in 2008. She also bettered her 25K time to 1:24:55 hours at the Berlin 25K, but was beaten into second place by Peninah Arusei. Elsewhere on the European circuit she won the Zwitserloot Dak Run 10K. She was absent for the 2009 and 2010 seasons, but returned to competition in 2011 with a new focus on the longer marathon event. She joined Volare Sports, a Dutch running club, in 2011 and opened the year with a third place finish at the Egmond Half Marathon. She dipped under one hour and ten minutes at the CPC Loop Den Haag, winning the race in a personal best of 1:09:06 hours despite cold temperatures. She came third at the Rabat Half Marathon in April, then won her second title at the Berlin 25K a month later, improving her time to 1:23:22 hours. A personal best of 1:08:22 hours came as part of her second career victory at the Zwolle Half Marathon and her time ranked her twelfth in the world that year. Later in the autumn European road season, she was third at the and won the Great Scottish Run in Glasgow. Chepchirchir also set a new 10K best at the Appingedam Stadsloop, finishing as runner-up in 32:13 minutes behind Joyce Chepkirui. All these performances built up to her marathon debut at the 2011 Frankfurt Marathon and she performed well on her first attempt by taking third place on the podium with a time of 2:24:21 hours. In her second marathon outing at the 2012 Prague International Marathon she moved one position up the podium to finish as runner-up to Agnes Kiprop. She ran a personal best of 1:08:06 to win the Lille Half Marathon, then came fourth at the 2012 Berlin Marathon. At the start of 2013 she was narrowly beaten at the Egmond Half Marathon by Helah Kiprop. She outran Ethiopian competition at the Seoul International Marathon in March to win the race in 2:25:43 hours. A new best of 2:23:00 hours came at the Frankfurt Marathon in October, where she was runner-up behind Caroline Kilel.\"b\\' \\n Max Planck Institute for Brain Research \\n Research \\n Research at the Max Planck Institute for Brain Research focuses on the operation of networks of neurons in the brain. The institute hosts three scientific departments (with directors Moritz Helmstaedter of the Helmstaedter Department, Gilles Laurent of the Laurent Department, and Erin Schuman of the Schuman Department), the Singer Emeritus Group, two Max Planck Research Groups, namely Johannes Letzkus\\\\\\' Neocortical Circuits Group and Tatjana Tchumatchenko\\\\\\'s Theory of Neural Dynamics Group, as well as several additional research units. The common research goal of the Institute is a mechanistic understanding of neurons and synapses, of the structural and functional circuits which they form, of the computational rules which describe their operations, and ultimately, of their roles in driving perception and behavior. The experimental focus is on all scales required to achieve this understanding - from networks of molecules in dendritic compartments to networks of interacting brain areas. This includes interdisciplinary analyses at the molecular, cellular, multi-cellular, network and behavioral levels, often combined with theoretical approaches. \\n History \\n The \"Kaiser-Wilhelm-Institut Hirnforschung\" (KWI for Brain Research) was founded in Berlin in 1914, making it one of the oldest institutes of the \"Kaiser Wilhelm Society for the Advancement of Science\", itself founded in 1911. It was based on the Neurologische Zentralstation (Neurological Center), a private research institute established by Oskar Vogt in 1898 and run together with his wife Vogt-Mugnier, also an accomplished brain researcher. From 1901 to 1910, Vogt\\\\\\'s coworker at this institute was Korbinian Brodmann, who in 1909 established the cytoarchitectonic classification of cortical areas still in use today (e.g., his area 17 is the primary visual cortex). Oskar Vogt\\\\\\'s own scientific achievements also were in the field of cortical cytoarchitectonics and myeloarchitectonics. In the 1920s Oskar Vogt became interested in the potential morphological correlates of mental abilities, and hence in the neuroanatomical study of \\\\\\'elite brains\\\\\\'. When Lenin died of a brain hemorrhage in 1924, his brain was preserved in formaldehyde, where it remained for two years. In 1926, Vogt was recruited by the Soviet government to help establish Lenin\\\\\\'s genius via histological investigation of his brain. He was given some space in Moscow to carry out this work and two years later, a spacious and representative brick building that had been confiscated from an American business. In it, he helped establish and then headed the Moscow Brain Institute. Between 1926 and 1930, Vogt travelled to Moscow several times to supervise the work on Lenin\\\\\\'s brain by the Russian collaborators who had been trained at Vogt\\\\\\'s KWI for Brain Research in Berlin. In 1927, Vogt gave a preliminary report on his findings in Moscow, concluding from his histological observations that Lenin must have been an athlete in associative thinking (\"Assoziationsathlet\") - a conclusion deemed farfetched by some of his neurologist colleagues and adversaries. Lenin\\\\\\'s brain was, for a time, on display in the Lenin Mausoleum and now rests at Moscow\\\\\\'s Brain Institute. World War I delayed the plans for a new building to house the KWI for Brain Research. The KWI\\\\\\'s first proper building in Berlin-Buch was only inaugurated in 1931 under the directorship of Oskar Vogt. It was the world\\\\\\'s largest and most modern brain research institute of its time, including Departments of Neurophysiology and Neurochemistry (Marthe Vogt and Veit), Genetics a Research Clinic (Soeken, Zwirner), and the Neuroanatomical Departments of Oskar and his wife Vogt. Based on critical remarks Vogt had made about national socialism, a protective attitude towards Jewish coworkers at the institute, and rumors that he was a communist (spirited by his Moscow contacts), Vogt was pressed to early retirement by 1937. The Vogts moved to Neustadt in the Black Forest and established another private brain research institute, funded in part by the family of steel baron Krupp (who had already funded first private institute in Berlin) and by own funds. In 1937, Hugo Spatz, a pupil of Franz Nissl, became Vogt\\\\\\'s successor as director of the KWI for Brain Research and head of the Neuroanatomy Department. During his tenure, the Departments of Neuropathology (Hallervorden) and of Tumor Research were added. One focus of both and histological research were pathologies of the extrapyramidal/motor system. In a previous collaboration they had described an extrapyramidal disease that was later named Hallervorden-Spatz syndrome.  Between 1940 and 1945, Hallervorden and Spatz became involved in the atrocities of the Nazi regime by studying the brains of euthanasia victims. For many years, brain sections from these studies remained archived in the institute (which by then had become the Max Planck Institute for Brain Research in Frankfurt am Main) together with research material from other periods. When this was recognized, all sections dating from the period 1933-1945 were given a burial at a Munich cemetery by the Max Planck Society in 1990. A memorial stone was erected in honor of the victims of these atrocities. Use of the eponym Hallervorden-Spatz syndrome is strongly discouraged due to Hallervorden and Spatz\\\\\\'s involvement with the Nazi party and was replaced by the more descriptive terminology pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration. After 1945, the different departments of the KWI for Brain Research were relocated to Dillenburg, Giessen, Marburg and In 1948 the Max Planck Society was founded to succeed the Kaiser Wilhelm Society, and the institute became the Max Planck Institute for Brain Research. Hallervorden retired as director in 1955, Spatz in 1959. In 1962, a new building was erected in Frankfurt-Niederrad to house the Departments of Neurobiology (Hassler, Director 1959-1982) and Neuropathology Director 1956-1979), as well as the Research Groups \"Evolution of the Primate Brain\" (Stephan) and \"Neurochemistry\" (Werner). Rolf Hassler, a pupil of Oskar Vogt and coworker of the famous Freiburg neurologist Richard Jung, studied subcortical brain areas, thalamo-cortical systems, basal ganglia and the limbic system. Wilhelm a pupil of Hallervorden, was a renowned specialist on peripheral neuropathies. He was the reason for the institute\\\\\\'s relocation to Frankfurt, as he was simultaneously head of the \\\\\\'Edinger Institute\\\\\\', the Neuropathology Department of Frankfurt University\\\\\\'s Medical School. In 1982, the KWI for Brain Research\\\\\\'s Department of General Neurology, which had been relocated to became the Max Planck Institute for Neurological Research in that city, independent of the MPI for Brain Research. The other relocated departments of the KWI were closed with the retirement of their directors. In 1981, the MPIH was restructured towards non-clinical, basic neuroscience through the establishment of the Departments of Neuroanatomy Director 1981-2008) and Neurophysiology (Singer, Director 1982-2011), followed by the Department of Neurochemistry (Betz, Director 1991-2009). Heinz conducted functional and structural studies of the mammalian retina, Heinrich Betz analyzed the molecular components of synapses, and Wolf Singer studied higher cognitive functions with a focus on the visual system. In the first decade of the new millennium, the MPG defined the analysis of neural networks as a central research topic for the institute. In 2008 Erin Schuman and Gilles Laurent were appointed as directors of the departments \"Synaptic Plasticity\" and \"Neural Systems\", respectively. The new departments took up work in the summer of 2009 and were initially located in interim facilities on the Science Campus \"Riedberg\" of the Frankfurt University. The construction of a new building for the institute on this campus was recently finalized, next to the MPI of Biophysics. The new institute building currently houses the three departments of the institute (those of Erin Schuman, Gilles Laurent and Moritz Helmstaedter), several Research Groups at the institute (Tatjana Tchumatchenko and Johannes Letzkus recently joined as Max Planck Group Leaders in 2013), several core facilities, and the Max Planck Research Unit for Neurogenetics of Peter Mombaerts. As of 2016, Moritz Helmstaedter is the Managing Director of the Institute. \\n Graduate Program \\n The International Max Planck Research School (IMPRS) for Neural Circuits is a graduate program offering a Ph.D. The school is run in cooperation with the Max Planck Institute of Biophysics and the Johann Wolfgang Goethe University of Frankfurt am Main as well as the Frankfurt Institute for Advanced Studies and the Ernst Institute.\\'b\\' \\n Savio Preparatory High School \\n History \\n The school was founded as an all-boys school in 1958 by the Salesians of Don Bosco, a Catholic religious order. It was called St. Dominic Savio High School and served predominantly blue-collar Italian American and Irish American families in East Boston, Revere, Winthrop, and Chelsea. Enrollment grew until the late 1970s, with peak at about 440 students. Those years saw a variety of new clubs and sports spring up. In 1970, alumnus, Paul Abbott, recalled a day when the student body voted on whether the school should add football or hockey as a new sport: \"It was 1970, the Bobby Orr era in Boston, so we chose hockey.\" In the 80s, the school suffered from decreasing enrollment and rising costs, partially due to an aging campus and shrinking pool of low-salaried Salesians, leading to increasing dependence on more expensive lay teachers. At the end of the 1992-1993 school year, as part of a continual process to cut back on services due to a decrease in the number of priests and brothers, the Salesians announced that the school would be closing, a revelation that caused an uproar in the community.  The decline made it harder to keep up facilities, and an increase in costs in areas such as healthcare needed to take care of an aging priest population. A group of alumnilead by Peter J Bagley, 75 stepped in and eventually the Salesians agreed to cede control of the school to the group, initially with no charge for property rental. In September 1993, St. Dominic Savio High was reincarnated as Savio Preparatory High School. Though there was no gap between the Salesians administering the school and the alumni taking over, the period of indecision that preceded the change saw many faculty members and students relocate to other schools.  Savio became coeducational in an effort to increase enrollment. \\n New direction \\n Under the leadership of the Board and Fr. John Serio, S.D.B., from 1996-2002, Savio Prep\\\\\\'s enrollment grew to 400 students. In 2005, however, the athletic director, James Doherty plead guilty to charges of indecent assault and three counts of molesting female students.  Then, in 2006, the wrestling coach plead guilty to molesting two male students and hazing multiple others. These incidents caused enrollment to drop, and money to dry up. The building fell further into disrepair. \\n School closed \\n At the end of the 2006-2007 school year, the Salesian owners of the building did not renew the lease, citing the deterioration of the condition of the building and lack of funds to repair it. Concerned parents and alumni began meeting to discuss ways to keep the school open. The group called themselves \"Save Our Savio,\" but could never muster enough funding or support to find the school a new location.  It was clear that 2006-2007 had been the last St. Dominic Savio school year. In 2008, it was revealed that the school administration rejected an offer to join the Christo Rey School Network, which would have saved the school financially. The building now houses the Edward W. Brooke Charter School.  An addition has been built on the site of the former Salesian residence.\\'b\\' \\n Prototype (1992 film) \\n Plot summary \\n Set in a post-apocalyptic Los Angeles of 2057, Hawkins Coselow, a crippled soldier, along with his ex-lover, Chandra Kerkorian, share vivid psychosexual dreams.  Dr. Alexis Zalazny is working on a cybernetic program that will help Coselow walk again. The program sort of works, but everything goes deadly wrong when Coselow becomes a killing machine that can interface with any computer. He ends up killing several people belonging to a resistance movement. The rebels are led by Omegas, cybernetically altered humans, battled government forces in the crime-ridden streets. In time, the Omegas reprogrammed themselves and carried out their own deadly agenda. In the end, the Omegas were destroyed, except one - implanted in a child, Chandra Kerkorian. Now grown, she is ready to lead the rebellion again.\\'b\\' \\n Malcolm Peat \\n Early Professional \\n Between 1960 and 1970 Peat was Advisor to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and British Advisor to the Ministries of Health in South and South East Asia. His involvement in the British International Development Program in India, Burma, Thailand and the Philippines, for the Government of the United Kingdom, included developed educational programs in Rehabilitation in Southeast and South Asia. For this work he was named a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE). early academic professional contributions in Canada were in human movement analysis with seminal contributions made in electromyographic and anatomical studies of the shoulder and normal and pathological gait analysis. \\n Academic Posts \\n Peat began his academic career in 1971 as Lecturer, then Assistant Professor in the School of Medical Rehabilitation, Faculty of Medicine, University of Manitoba From 1976 to 1984, he was Associate Professor, then Professor and Director of the Program in Physical Therapy, Faculty of Medicine, University of Western Ontario. In 1984, he became Professor and Director of the School of Rehabilitation Therapy, and Associate Dean of the Faculty of Health Sciences at University, Kingston, Ontario. He also was the Associate Dean, Office of International Programs until his retirement. \\n International Development \\n Peat has been responsible for furthering the design, development, implementation and evaluation of disability and rehabilitation worldwide. He was the Founding Executive Director of the International. Centre for the Advancement of Community Based Rehabilitation, a Centre of Excellence funded by Foreign Affairs, Government of Canada. Many of these activities have been in Asia, in Countries of Conflict and Post-Conflict in Central and Eastern Europe, and Central America. He has worked with Ministries of Health in various countries in the development of disability policies, policy frameworks and legislation for community based rehabilitation (CBR), scope of practice guidelines, and the formal establishment of CBR within public health systems. Peat also strengthened the capacity of universities and civil society groups in the development of curricula for personnel (students and faculty) and in preparing professionals for community practice. extensive experience in policy development, human resources planning, gender equity, training, legislation and accreditation in the area of disability and CBR within health, social and education sectors have made him highly respected in the international community. Peat died suddenly on 17 January 2017 while on a vacation cruise in Italy. He was 84.\\'b\\' \\n John Davy Hayward \\n John Davy Hayward (2 February 1905 1965) was an English editor, critic, anthologist and bibliophile. \\n Early life \\n Hayward was educated at Gresham\\\\\\'s School and in France before going up to King\\\\\\'s College, Cambridge in 1923 to read English and modern languages. While still a Cambridge undergraduate, he edited and published the Collected Works of the Earl of Rochester. \\n Career \\n From 1927, Hayward lived in London, working as an editor, critic, anthologist and bibliographer. He edited many of Jonathan Swift\\\\\\'s works. In 1929, he edited John Donne, Dean of St Paul\\\\\\'s: Complete Poetry and Selected Prose for the Nonesuch Press. For eleven years, from 1946 to 1957, he shared a house with his close friend the poet T. S. Eliot, gathering and archiving Eliot\\\\\\'s papers and styling himself Keeper of the Eliot Archive. Eliot\\\\\\'s book of verse called Poems Written in Early Youth was compiled and edited by Hayward. With Eliot\\\\\\'s help he emended the poems from The Harvard Advocate and added the poems from Eliot\\\\\\'s days at St. Louis\\\\\\' Smith Academy, plus the previously unpublished \"The Death of Saint Narcissus\". This friendship was strained by Eliot\\\\\\'s unexpected marriage in January 1957 to his secretary Valerie Fletcher. To a large extent, she took over Hayward\\\\\\'s functions in Eliot\\\\\\'s life after they separated their households. Since the mid-1920s Hayward had suffered from muscular dystrophy, and he died in 1965, a few months after Eliot. He bequeathed his entire collection of the literary manuscripts of T.S. Eliot to King\\\\\\'s College, Cambridge.\\'b\" \\n Impy\\'s Island \\n Plot summary \\n On a magical tropical island called Tikiwoo in the 1950s, a fun-loving group of misfit animals and people make a marvelous discovery: a baby dinosaur frozen since prehistoric times. Little Impy, as they call him, is loving his new family and ready to explore the strange new world. but when a king from a faraway country vows to capture the lovable baby dino for his private collection, all the inhabitants of Impy\\'s island must join together to save their new friend. \\n Sequel \\n https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1210117/fullcredits?ref_=tt_cl_sm#cast\"b\\' \\n Hassan Saeed \\n Education \\n Educated in International Islamic University Malaysia before earning his Ph.D. at the University of Queensland in Australia, Saeed served as the Chief Justice of the Criminal Court before being appointed as Attorney-General. \\n New Maldives Trio \\n A leading member of the New Maldives faction of the governing Maldivian People\\\\\\'s Party (DRP), Saeed was elected as the Vice President of DRP in April 2006. The same month he also co-founded with Dr. Ahmed Shaheed, a fellow graduate of the University of Queensland and Minister of Foreign Affairs and Mohamed Jameel Ahmedl. Saeed was thrust into the limelight as President Gayoom began a new term of office committed to a rapid overhaul of the country\\\\\\'s archaic governance system and legal framework, shortly after riots rocked the capital in the aftermath of the killing of four persons in prison, discrediting the country\\\\\\'s archaic penal and legal system. Saeed supported a reform agenda proposed by President Gayoom. He proposed a 5-year plan to reform the criminal justice system, beginning 2005, to overhaul the nation\\\\\\'s legal framework, penal system and the judiciary. He tabled a new Penal Code before the parliament. Together with Foreign Minister Shaheed and the Information Minister Mohamed Nasheed (not Mohamed Nasheed), Saeed is also the chief architect of the alleged Road map for the Reform Agenda published in March 2006 by President Gayoom regime. \\n With the defected faction \\n After 4 and half years in the cabinet the then Attorney General Saeed and Justice Minister Mohamed Jameel Ahmed resigned from the government in what was viewed as a setback for the reformist credentials of President Gayoom. The resignations were submitted at August 5, 2007, 2:30 pm, and Saeed and Jameel arrived at Daabaurgue for a press conference just after 3:30 pm. Accusing Gayoom of misdeeds, Hassan Saeed said have resigned because the reform agenda, which I joined the government for, has failed, and it is not appropriate for me to stay in the Following his resignation from the Cabinet, Saeed, along with former Foreign Minister Ahmed Shaheed and former Justice Minister Mohmamed Jameel Ahmed has set up a corporate and business law firm called \"Raajje Chambers\". \\n Presidential Bid \\n Gayoom\\\\\\'s defected New Maldives trio with Hassan Saeed as the front runner contended for 2008 Maldives Presidential Election as an independent candidate, Hassan Saeed as the presidential candidate chose Ahmed Shaheed as his running mate.  He came third behind the incumbent President Gayyoom and Mr. Nasheed, Maldivian Democratic Party Candidate. With Saeed\\\\\\'s backing in the second of election, Mr Nasheed was able to bring to an end of the 30 year rule of Gayyoom. \\n Islam \\n A madrasa student and Islamic Scholar, Saeed is an advocate of liberal Islam and is the co-author of the book Freedom of Religion, Apostasy and Islam, a book that elucidates the position of Muslim scholars on apostasy and practice prevailing in the Muslim community. In the book the authors Abdullah Saeed and Hassan Saeed argue that the law of apostasy and its punishment by death in Islamic law conflicts with a variety of fundamentals of Islam. They contend that the early development of the law of apostasy was essentially a religio-political tool, and that there was a large diversity of opinion among early Muslims on the punishment. Saeed has argued in the newspaper Indian Express that Islamic anger over the U.S. invasion of Iraq, along with increasing Internet access to the Maldives, has caused a shift towards greater fundamentalism. Saeed is also a Barrister-at-Law in the High Court of Australia. He is also an Advocate and Solicitor in the Republic of Maldives. He has written editorials in the British newspaper The Guardian advocating democracy in the Maldives.\\'b\" \\n Michel Ferlus \\n Biography \\n Michel Ferlus was born in 1935. He followed classes in ethnology and prehistory taught by Leroi-Gourhan; in \\'primitive religions\\' by Roger Bastide; in linguistics by Martinet; and in Southeast Asian languages and history by George He worked in Laos as a teacher from 1961 to 1968. This allowed him to do fieldwork on languages of Laos, including Hmong and Yao (Hmong-Mien family), Khmu/Khamou and Lamet (Austroasiatic/Mon-Khmer), as well as Phu Noi/Phou-Noy (Sino-Tibetan). He became a researcher at Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique in 1968.  He mainly did fieldwork in Thailand and Burma (Myanmar) in the 1980s, studying Wa, Lawa, Palaung, Mon and Nyah Kur; in Vietnam and Laos in the 1990s, studying Viet-Muong (also known as Vietic) languages, and the Tai languages and writing systems of northern and central areas of Vietnam, including the Lai Pao writing system of Vietnam, which was close to falling into oblivion. He has published extensively about his findings on numerous languages of Laos, Thailand, Burma/Myanmar, and Vietnam, in journals such as Mon-Khmer Studies, Cahiers de Linguistique Asie Orientale and Diachronica. \\n Main findings \\n Michel Ferlus\\'s main discoveries relate to the effects of monosyllabicization on the phonological structure of Southeast Asian languages. Tonogenesis (the development of lexical tones), registrogenesis (the development of lexically contrastive phonation-type registers), the evolution of vowel systems all partake in a general (panchronic) model of evolution. Phenomena such as the spirantization of medial obstruents, which resulted in a major historical change in the sound inventory of Vietnamese, are also part of the broad set of in swept through East/Southeast Asia.\"b\\' \\n FLOSS Weekly \\n History \\n FLOSS Weekly was started by Leo Laporte, who runs the TWiT netcast network, and Chris DiBona, now the open source program manager at Google. FLOSS is an acronym for Free/Libre Open Source Software. The show was intended to be a weekly interview with the biggest names and influences in open source software. Episode one of FLOSS Weekly appeared on April 7, 2006. Towards the end of 2006, episodes began to appear less frequently, dropping to a monthly basis. DiBona\\\\\\'s newborn baby and commitments at Google were cited as reasons for the show\\\\\\'s stagnation, and on the seventeenth episode, Laporte appealed for other co-hosts to share the burden. This was DiBona\\\\\\'s final appearance on the show as the host. He returned as a guest for the show\\\\\\'s 100th episode. The show went on an unannounced three-month hiatus, re-appearing on July 21, 2007, with a new co-host, Randal Schwartz, who had previously appeared on the show as a guest. Schwartz has since taken over organizing guests for the show, and has restored the show to a predominantly weekly schedule (with occasional gaps from scheduling conflicts or last minute cancellations). Starting with episode 69, Jono Bacon was a somewhat regular co-host, even filling in for Randal when Randal wasn\\\\\\'t available. The show was nominated for the 2009 Podcast Awards in the Technology/Science category. In May 2010, the show began publishing a video feed (along with many of the rest of the TWiT network shows), and moved to an earlier recording time. As a result of the new recording time, Leo Laporte stepped down as the lead host, and Jono Bacon could no longer regularly co-host.  Randal Schwartz is supported by a rotating panel of co-hosts, selected on the basis of availability and appropriateness for the guest. The list includes  Guillermo Amaral, Gareth Greenaway, Dan Lynch, Aaron Newcomb, Jonathan Bennett and Simon Phipps and has previously included Joe Brockmeier and Randi Harper. \\n Format \\n Most episodes feature the primary developer or developers of a particular open source software project. The show is an open discussion, with the host and co-host asking questions about the nature of the project. Typically, the interviewers will ask the guests about the history of the project, and its development model (such as which language it is written in, which version control system is used, and what development environment the author uses). Some shows, such as the interviews with Jon \"maddog\" Hall and Simon Phipps, are not specific to an open source project, and feature more general topics, such as the philosophy of free and open-source software. Shows begin and end with a brief discussion between the hosts, before and after calling the guest. Often the guests are interviewed via Skype, with Laporte\\\\\\'s staff at TWiT being responsible for the audio recording and production. FLOSS Weekly has been supported by advertising and donations.

In 1962, Buchanan graduated from Bennett College, in Greensboro, North Carolina, a historically black women\\\\\\'s college, with a bachelor of science degree in medical technology. She went on to attend Columbia University, where she received a master\\\\\\'s degree in parasitology in 1968, and a master\\\\\\'s degree in public health in 1969. Although she was accepted to medical school, Buchanan decided not to go due to her desire to dedicate more time to her art. In 1971, she enrolled in a class taught by Norman Lewis at the Art Students League in New York City. Lewis, along with artist Romare Bearden, became friends and mentors to Buchanan. Buchanan decided to become a full-time artist in 1977 after exhibiting her work in a new talent show at Betty Parsons Gallery. In the same year, she moved to Macon, Georgia. On July 4, 2015, Buchanan died in Ann Arbor, Michigan at the age of seventy-four. \\n Career \\n Buchanan has created drawings, sculpture, prints, video, and land art. In 1976 and 1977, Buchanan drew \"black walls\" on paper. She \"wanted to see what the wall looked like on the other side\" and put four walls together in three dimensions. She then began to sculpt in cement. An example of a three-dimensional work from her early career is the sculpture \"Ruins and Rituals\" at the Museum of Arts and Sciences in Macon, Georgia, part of a series of concrete structures that recall ancient tombs. Buchanan is best known for her many paintings and sculptures on the \"shack,\" a rudimentary dwelling associated with the poor. Scholar Marquardt argues that Buchanan treats shacks not as documentary elements but as \"images of endurance and personal history\"; often using bright colors and a style of childlike simplicity, the works \"evoke the warmth and happiness that can be found even in the meanest dwelling, representing the faith and caring that is not reserved for privileged classes.\" Her art takes the form of stone pedestals, bric-a brac assemblages, funny poems, self portraits and sculptural shacks. But potent themes of identity, place and collective memory unite the works uncovering the animus that runs through them: to connect with those around her and reckon with the history that shaped her communities. In 1981 Buchanan created Marsh Ruins, a temporal land art sculpture in coastal Georgia near a commentated site known as Marshes of To the east of the work was Saint Simons Island, where a group of Igbo people sold into slavery collectively drowned themselves in 1803. This work bears witness to the unmarked histories of enslaved peoples. There she planted three concrete forms and covered them with layers of tabby, a mixture used in slave living quarters. Marsh Ruins gradually disintegrated into the marsh. Buchanan captured that erosion process on video. Buchanan said of her work, \"My work is a logical progression of my early interest in textures and surfaces and walls. The early \"walls\" were lonely, freestanding, fragmented things. When I lived in New York I was looking for things that were demolished. That gave them character. I liked to imagine who might have lived in the apartment, and whose home it might have been. Each family that moved in repainted the walls their color. When a building is torn down the various layers of color are exposed. It is almost surgical--like looking through a microscope and looking at different layers of tissue and media.\" In the fall of 2016 a comprehensive exhibition of her work opened at the Brooklyn Museum in the Elizabeth A. Sackler Center for Feminist Art. Beverly Buchanan - Ruins and Rituals featured painting, sculptures, drawings, as well as the artist\\\\\\'s notebooks and photographs form her personal archive. Buchanan\\\\\\'s work was featured at the Independent Art Fair 2017 at Andrew Edlin Gallery\\\\\\'s booth. Buchanan has remarked, \"A lot of my pieces have the word in their titles because I think that tells you this object has been through a lot and survived the idea behind the sculptures like, I am; still here!\\\\\\'\" Buchanan\\\\\\'s work is in the collection of the Addison Art Gallery of American Art at Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts, Georgia Museum of Art, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and the Whitney Museum of American Art.\\'b\\' \\n Rhipsalis baccifera \\n Taxonomy \\n The species shows considerable polymorphism and can be divided into numerous subspecies. Mesoamerican specimens are usually tetraploid and South American specimens are diploid. The genera currently assigned to the tribe Rhipsalideae (which include Hatiora, Lepismium, and Schlumbergera in addition to Rhipsalis) were subject to considerable confusion and disagreement prior to the clarification by Wilhelm Barthlott and Nigel Taylor in 1995.\\'b\" \\n John Hewitt (antiquary) \\n John Hewitt was an English antiquarian. \\n Life \\n Born at Lichfield, he studied music in youth, and was for some time organist of St. Mary\\'s Church there. Subsequently he was appointed to a post in the War Office. It brought him into the Tower of London. He worked under Robert Porrett, was encouraged to take an interest in the national collection of arms and armour there, and produced a pioneering guide. While living in London was well known in literary society. He enjoyed the friendship of Bulwer Lytton, Mary Howitt, Anna Maria Hall, Allan Cunningham, Leigh Hunt, and others. For many years he resided at Woolwich, but on his retirement from the War Office he returned to Lichfield, where he died on 10 January 1878.\"b\" \\n Mam\\'zelle Guillotine \\n Plot summary \\n Mam\\'zelle Guillotine follows Gabrielle Damiens, the daughter of Francois Damiens, a man arrested for attacking the King of France with a pocket knife. Although the wound was minor, Damiens\\' punishment for drawing royal blood was to be hanged, drawn and quartered. At age 16, Gabrielle finds letters written by her father which prove that his crime had been instigated and aided by a body of noble gentlemen, who planned it as warning to the King to change his ways. Damiens bore the brunt of this conspiracy in silence while the aristocrats remained immune. With the evidence of their crime, Gabrielle sets out to confront the Marquis de Saint-Lucque, the only person named in the letters, and succeeds in extorting a large amount of money from him. She also starts an affair with his son, Vicomte Fernand, who is oblivious to the whole situation. Before long Gabrielle is living in luxury and has aspirations to marry the young Vicomte. Her plans are dashed when Fernand breaks off their affair as the King has decided that the Vicomte should marry his illegitimate daughter, Neve de Nesle. Furious, Gabrielle tries to blackmail Vicomte into marrying her using the letters which prove his father\\'s guilt. But she has not counted on Neve\\'s mother, Madame de Nesle, who on hearing of the situation, uses her position as the King\\'s favourite to have Gabrielle, now 19, thrown into prison without trial. She spends the next in prison, feeding her rage and lust for revenge on the Saint-Lucque family. On 14 July 1789 she is released from the Bastille after it is stormed by the mob, the French Revolution having begun. Mad for revenge, Gabrielle works her way into the favour of the men behind the new republic, and before long has become the public executioner of Artois. As France\\'s only female executioner she is feared by many and known throughout Artois as Mam\\'zelle Guillotine. When the Saint-Lucque family (Fernand, Neve and their three children) are captured as traitors, Gabrielle determines that finally she will have her revenge. English spies manage to rescue the Marquis and his young son, but his wife and two daughters are still in danger of being sent to the guillotine. Gabrielle fails to notice that the new sleuth sent from Paris by Chauvelin to track down the English spies is really the Scarlet Pimpernel in disguise. \\n Reception \\n The character of Gabrielle has been interpreted as a \\'figure of fun\\' yet also \\'a highly dangerous opponent\\'. Sally Duggan notes that Orczy invokes biblical language to celebrate Gabrielle\\'s downfall at the end of the book - depicting the Frenchwoman as \\'a warning to all assertive females\\'.\"b\" \\n Wang Wu (painter) \\n Wang Wu (Chinese: pinyin: Wang Wu); ca. 1632-1690 was a Chinese painter and poet during the Qing Dynasty Wang was born in Wu country in the Jiangsu province. His style name was \\'Qingzhong\\' and his sobriquets were \\'Xuedian daoren and Wang\\'an\\'. Wang specialized in bird-and-flower painting, using a brilliant and minute style. Unlike many painters of the time, Wang was not affiliated with any school of painting.\"b\\' \\n Okrug Gornji \\n Okrug is a municipality located on the western side of the island of Croatia. It is divided into Okrug Gornji and Okrug Donji, two traditional Dalmatian villages. It is the centre of the Dalmatian micro region by its geographical position. It has a mild Mediterranean climate, dense subtropical and Mediterranean vegetation, an archipelago of little islands, little bays and beaches. Okrug is claimed to be one of the most attractive tourist destinations in Croatia with its 2,670 sunny hours per year. There are many restaurants and taverns in Okrug Gornji and Donji with a varied choice of original Dalmatian specialities. The average temperature is and 281 days in the year have an average temperature above \\n Accommodation - Apartments for Rent \\n The old settlement Okrug Gornji is a small fishermen harbor at the end of the beach. Nowadays, Okrug Gornji with Okrug Donji are tourist centers. Okrug Gornji Tourist Info\\'b\\' \\n Whitney Avenue Historic District \\n Commercial buildings \\n Per the NRHP nomination, small commercial buildings or \"houses which have been fitted with storefronts\", primarily at corners or along Orange Avenue are included in, and serve, the district. An unusual example is the Hall-Benedict Drug Company Building, a building on Orange Street, which is separately listed on the National Register. \\n Summary \\n Per the NRHP nomination, In summary, the district is distinguished by its exceptional number of architecturally significant houses; the wide, shady, tree-lined streets which provide an appropriate setting for those houses; and by the high proportion of buildings which have retained their integrity of materials and design. Together these attributes create the sense of historic and architectural cohesiveness which makes this area a distinctive cultural resource. \\n Relationship to neighborhoods \\n The historic district primarily in the East Rock neighborhood but also extending into the Prospect Hill neighborhood of the city of New Haven, Connecticut. The row of properties on the west side of Whitney Avenue is officially in the Prospect Hill neighborhood planning area.\\'b\\' \\n The Creeps (Get on the Dancefloor) \\n Music video \\n The music video shows a male security guard who works in a mortuary. As he patrols the mortuary, three female corpses with vampyric elongated canines come to life and chase him through the facility. He is cornered at a locked door, but as they attack the scene changes to leave him on his own. He returns to the security centre to watch the CCTV replay where he sees the truth. The three girls were real, and are shown sensually attacking him with their canines.\\'b\\' \\n Formula 500 \\n F500 engines \\n Formula 500 cars are powered by a two-cylinder, water-cooled two-stroke engine. Modern cars use either the Rotax 494, or Rotax 493 originally produced for Ski-Doo snowmobiles. Older cars, mostly used for Solo events these days use the Kawasaki 440/A engine. The AMW 500L-85/250-2 R2c engine, while legal for use in Formula 500 racing, is rarely used these days. The Kawasaki 440/A engine, produced by Kawasaki, is a piston port engine utilizing Mikuni VM series carburetors and a tuned dual exhaust. While this engine is no longer competitive in road racing, it is still widely used in Solo II and Autocross events. Like all F500 engines, except for the AMW, the Kawasaki was originally produced as a snowmobile engine. It has been out of production since the early 1980s. Parts for these engines are becoming more difficult to find. The AMW 500L-85 engine, built by Two Stroke International was introduced to F500 in 1994. It is a reed valve engine using twin Mikuni SuperBN carburetors. To keep the performance of these larger, more powerful engines in line with prior engines, SCCA mandates the use of a spec Y exhaust manifold and single tuned pipe on the AMW engine. Unlike the other engines used in F500, the AMW engine is a derivative of a light aircraft engine. This engine is no longer in production, and is not supported by the manufacturer. Introduced for the 1997 season was the Rotax 494 engine. Rotax builds racing and industrial engines for a wide variety of applications, including aircraft, motorcycles, go-karts, snowmobiles and watercraft, The Rotax 494 engine is a 499cc rotary-valve engine. Like the AMW, the Rotax utilizes a 2 into 1 \"Y\" exhaust manifold and a single tuned expansion chamber exhaust. The Rotax engine utilizes the same Mikuni VM carburetors as the Kawasaki. The Rotax engine has become, by far, the most popular engine in F500 road racing. The Rotax 494 went out of production for Ski-Doo following the 2000 model year. Ski-Doo/Rotax ended support for it shortly thereafter. Some parts however, are still available through dealers and online outlets. In 2004 SCCA added the Rotax 493 to the list of approved engines. The 493 has the same bore and stroke as the 494. However, unlike the 494, is a reed valve engine. It also runs Mikuni VM series carbs and the \"Y\" exhaust manifold like its cousin the 494. Cars running the 493 engine are required to run at a higher minimum weight to maintain parity with the older 494 and AMW engines. Like the 494, the 493 also went out of production for Ski-Doo following the 2003 model year. Support for it ended in 2007. As with the 494, some parts are still available through dealers and online outlets. In 2011 SCCA added the Rotax 593 to the list of approved engines. The 593, (more commonly known as the Ski-Doo 500ss) is a 600cc version of the reed valve 493 engine. It also runs Mikuni VM series carbs and the \"Y\" exhaust manifold like the other Rotax engines, but are required to run a specified intake restrictor to keep power output on par with the 500cc 493 engine. Cars running the 593 engine are also required to run at a higher minimum weight to maintain parity with the older 494 and AMW engines. The 593 remains in production for Ski-Doo to date, rebadged from \"500ss\" to \"600\" in 2010. Engine specifications are tightly regulated by the SCCA. No engine modifications are permitted in formula 500. Engines must be run in stock form \"as delivered\" from the factory. No aftermarket parts, port modifications, or other variations from stock configuration are allowed. This helps keep costs down and means close competition on the track. \\n F500 transmission \\n F500 uses an advanced Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT), similar to that used in snowmobiles. These simple belt driven automatic transmissions are tuned to optimize the power curve of a two-stroke engine, constantly keeping the engine at its peak power. One of the key benefits of the CVT is that it is a stepless transmission. This allows all of the engine\\\\\\'s power to be transmitted to the drive wheels at all times.\\'b\" \\n Natalia Shustova \\n Early life and education \\n Shustova studied materials science at Moscow State University and graduated with a Master\\'s degree in 2005. She remained there for a doctoral degree in physical chemistry, before moving to the United States where she joined Colorado State University. Here she concentrated on inorganic chemistry, and earned a second doctorate in fullerene chemistry under the supervision of Steve Strauss in 2010. She was appointed as a postdoctoral research associate at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where she worked in the laboratory of Mircea until 2013. \\n Research and career \\n In 2013 Shustova was appointed Assistant Professor of Chemistry at the University of South Carolina. Her work has considered materials for sustainable energy conversion, including frameworks, covalent organic frameworks and graphitic hybrid materials. She is interested in morphological control of bulk heterojunction solar cells as well as designing chromophore assemblies to control resonance energy transfer. Shustova was promoted to the Peter and Bonnie McCausland Associate Professor in 2019. Her recent work has considered donor acceptor materials with integrated These structures offer crystallinity, high surface areas and tunable electronic properties, and can achieve good electronic conductivity.\"b\\' \\n Illinois Steel Company \\n The Illinois Steel Company was an American steel producer with five plants in Illinois and Wisconsin. Founded through a consolidation in 1889, Illinois Steel grew to become the largest steel producer in the United States. In 1898, several other steel and transportation companies were merged into it to form the Federal Steel Company, itself merged into U.S. Steel in 1901. \\n History \\n The first mill associated with the Illinois Steel Company was the North Chicago Rolling Mill, founded in Chicago, Illinois in 1857 as a mill to re-roll iron rails. In 1865, this mill was converted into a steel mill, shortly after the Bessemer process was introduced. The Illinois Steel Company was founded in 1899 following the consolidation of three companies. The North Chicago Rolling Mill Company had plants in Chicago, South Chicago, Chicago (1880), and Milwaukee, Wisconsin (1868). The Union Iron Company (1863) of Chicago and the Joliet Steel Company (1870) were also involved in the merge. The company was based in the Rookery Building in downtown Chicago. Branch offices operated in the Empire Building in New York, New York; the Pioneer Press Building in Saint Paul, Minnesota; the Cuyahoga Building in Cleveland, Ohio; the Security Building in St. Louis, Missouri; and an office in Denver, Colorado. The Illinois Steel Company became the largest steel company in the state. The company also owned a controlling interest in the Chicago, Lake Shore and Eastern Railway, coal mines in West Virginia and Pennsylvania, iron mines in Michigan and Wisconsin, and limestone mines in Indiana. Illinois Steel grew to become the largest steel and iron producer in the country by the late 1880s, (As did Carnegie and Lackawanna) producing over 1.1 million tons of pig iron and about one million tons of steel. The company specialized in rail track (including rail, fastenings, and ties), steel bars, steel plates, mineral wool, wire, pig iron, and hydraulic Portland cement. Railroads using Illinois Steel products included the Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe, Wabash, Chicago & Alton, and Baltimore & Ohio. Pig iron operations were handled in conjunction with Pickands, Brown & Company. The success of Illinois Steel did not go unchecked. The Carnegie Steel Company had a more efficient operation in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and sought to force Illinois Steel into receivership. Carnegie sold steel near Chicago at only eighteen dollars a ton, forcing Illinois Steel to sell their products below production cost. By 1896, Illinois Steel had drawn papers to place the company into receivership. Before these papers could be filed, however, Illinois Steel decided to focus on expanding their market to the west of Chicago, where Carnegie lacked sufficient supply lines. The strategy proved successful. In 1898, the Illinois Steel Company acquired the Minnesota Iron Company, Lorain Steel Company of Ohio, the Johnson Company of Pennsylvania, and the Elgin, Joliet & Eastern Railway, forming the Federal Steel Company. Upon completion of the merge, general counsel Elbert Henry Gary became president of the company. In February 1901, Gary worked with J. P. Morgan to have him acquire Carnegie Steel. Days after the acquisition was approved, Gray announced his intent to merge Federal Steel into Carnegie to form what would be known as U.S. Steel. The new company began operations on April 1, 1901.\\'b\\' \\n Charles B. Aycock High School \\n Mission Statement \\n The school\\\\\\'s Mission Statement is as follows: \"Charles B.

Featuring vocals from none other than One True Voice alumnus and former X Factor hopeful Daniel Pearce, it\\\\\\'s more likely to remind you of your local Flares nightclub than the hedonistic heyday of Studio 54. Close to the start of the track, Dizz warns: \"If you can\\\\\\'t say something nice, then keep quiet.\" We\\\\\\'d better keep our lips firmly shut then..\\'b\" \\n Taubman College of Architecture and Urban Planning \\n History \\n In 1876, the University of Michigan became one of the first universities in the United States to offer courses in architecture, led by influential Chicago architect William Le Baron Jenney. After thirty years, a degree program within the Department of Engineering was established in 1906, under the direction of Emil Lorch, who served to administer the program and its ever-evolving iterations until 1937. Housed in what is now Lorch Hall on Central Campus, the program quickly grew into the Department of Architecture by 1913. In 1923, world-renowned architect Eliel Saarinen joined the faculty of the department, with which he was associated during his design, construction, and subsequent presidency of the Cranbrook Academy of Art. By 1930, the College of Architecture had been established and grew to become the College of Architecture and Design in 1939, introducing Landscape Architecture and, by 1948, one of the first Master of City Planning degrees. The 1940s also saw the college taking a progressive role with regards to architectural research, establishing the Architecture Research Laboratory that would pioneer the integration of design, construction, technology, planning and research. In 1965, the Landscape Architecture program moved to the university\\'s School of Natural Resources. In 1968, the college made history by establishing the first-ever doctoral program in architecture, fueled by a strong level of academic inquiry into the field. In 1974, many positive changes took place in the college, including the separation of programs into the College of Architecture & Urban Planning and the School of Art & Design. During this same year, the programs outgrew their home on Central Campus and found a new home on North Campus, the Art and Architecture Building, in which both schools remain to this day. \\n Urban planning and design \\n The urban and regional planning program was recently ranked 13th in the nation in Planetizen\\'s 2014 Guide to Graduate Urban Planning Programs. The urban design program was recognized by New Urban News as the 4th best program in the nation for new urbanism. \\n Facilities \\n Taubman College is located on the University of Michigan\\'s North Campus in the Art & Architecture Building (A&AB). This building houses the largest academic studio in the world, at 30,000 continuous square feet, for roughly 450 undergraduate and graduate architecture students and graduate urban design students. On September 8, 2017, Taubman College opened the new A. Alfred Taubman Wing which provides an additional 36,000 square feet to the original 72,000 square foot facility, and the project includes a renovation of the existing college facilities. Architecture and urban planning education increasingly calls on spaces for group work and spaces to design and build. The wing and renovations provide additional studio space per student and collaboration rooms, as well as 5,700 square foot commons space which will also be used to host conferences, final reviews, and other special events. Designed by Preston Scott Cohen, Inc. (Design Architect) with Integrated Design Solutions (IDS) (Architect of Record), the building addition\\'s internal architecture is composed around a series of remarkable spiral-like stairs and ramps that create perambulatory sequences carefully choreographed to create encounters between faculty and students. Externally, a saw-tooth roof reflects warm light, unifying the orthogonal geometry of the studio with the hexagonal and ramped commons. A plaza underneath the new building provides and outside gathering and exhibition space to foster community. The building addition and renovation project was funded by a major gift from the late A. Alfred Taubman, as well as a generous gift from the late King C. Stutzman, additional funds from the U-M Offices of the President, Provost, and Chief Financial Officer, and the support of alumni and friends. The total budget for the entire project (addition and renovation of existing facilities) is $28.5 million. In fall 2009, the Taubman College completed a renovation of its Digital Fabrication Laboratory, or FABLab. The two-story space houses of computer-controlled fabrication equipment. The list of machines includes a 7 axis robotic work cell, two additional robotic work cells, two CNC routers, a abrasive water jet cutting machine, a Zund knife cutter, and a CNC milling machine. These machines give students and faculty the capability to digitally fabricate using any material at full scale. In addition the FABLab operates three rapid prototyping machines, and four laser cutters. A fully outfitted woodworking and welding shop complements the FABLab. http://taubmancollege.umich.edu/fablab/ North Campus is also home to the College of Engineering, the School of Computer Science, the School of Music, Theatre & Dance, and the Penny W. Stamps School of Art & Design. Other pertinent facilities on North Campus include the Art, Architecture & Engineering Library (AAEL), the Digital Media Commons, the Bentley Historical Library, the Gerald R. Ford Presidential Library and Maya Lin\\'s Wave Field.\"b\" \\n National Alliance of Concurrent Enrollment Partnerships \\n Standards for Accreditation \\n 15 standards cover expectations for accredited programs in the areas of curriculum, faculty, student assessment, student services, and program evaluation. Accreditation addresses program quality by requiring evidence of implementation of each standard. \\n NACEP Standards as a Model for Quality Control \\n NACEP standards have been recognized as a model for states that want to institute quality controls for dual enrollment programs and NACEP\\'s accreditation process has been acknowledged for its rigor. A number of states have either referenced NACEP in dual enrollment policies or laws, or have developed standards based on NACEP standards. These include: \\n Arkansas \\n The state concurrent enrollment policy states an institution of higher education offers a concurrent enrollment course(s) on a high school campus taught by a high school teacher, the institution must hold provisional membership in the National Alliance of Concurrent Enrollment Partnerships (NACEP) by January 31, 2008. Institutions that have offered concurrent enrollment courses on high school campuses taught by high school teachers for at least five years must become accredited members of NACEP by July 1, 2009. Those that have offered concurrent enrollment courses taught by high school instructors for less than five years must become accredited members as soon after July 1, 2009 as the five-year criteria is met. If NACEP broadens its scope of accreditation, institutions that fall within that scope will be required to hold provisional membership and gain \\n Florida \\n Florida\\'s February 2007 Statement of Standards is based on the NACEP Statement of Standards. Enacted by the Council of Presidents and the sponsored by the State Board of Education, the SoS has yet to be implemented due to a lack of interest and political commitment. No postsecondary school in Florida is yet a member of NACEP. \\n Idaho \\n Idaho\\'s state standards for concurrent enrollment programs is based on the NACEP Statement of Standards. \\n Illinois \\n The Illinois Dual Credit Task Force Report to the General Assembly recommends all institutions offering dual credit programs to comply with added criteria adapted from those used by the National Alliance for Concurrent Enrollment Partnerships (NACEP) for accrediting dual credit \\n Indiana \\n Indiana code states that postsecondary institutions and campuses offering dual credit courses in liberal arts, professional, or career/technical disciplines shall achieve accreditation by the National Alliance of Concurrent Enrollment Partnerships no later than fall \\n Iowa \\n The Senior Year Plus Course Auditing Committee is mandated by Iowa Code 256.17 to annually audit postsecondary courses offered to high school students in accordance with Iowa Code 261E. The committee adopted the NACEP standards and is linking the 2009-10 audit process with the accreditation process. \\n Minnesota \\n Minnesota statute states in fiscal year 2011, districts only are eligible for aid if the college or university concurrent enrollment courses offered by the district are accredited by the National Alliance of Concurrent Enrollment Partnerships, in the process of being accredited, or are shown by clear evidence to be of comparable standard to accredited \\n Oregon \\n Oregon public universities\\' proposed standards for College Now programs align with, and are heavily indebted to, the National Alliance of Concurrent Enrollment Partnerships \\n Disappearance of Kevin Palmer \\n Background into disappearance \\n Kevin Palmer worked as a timeshare salesman in Spain, where his wife and daughter lived with him. For reasons that were never explained, he travelled to the UK on March 12, 1999, with the intention of visiting Newcastle, but in fact went to Titchfield in Hampshire instead. He spent the evening of 12 March at the Abshot Hotel and Country Club with at least four other people, before getting a taxi to Bishop\\'s Waltham with two men (John Howett and Juan Arribas) and a woman. An argument broke out however between Palmer and his two male companions, and the trio left the cab. Arribas and Howett returned to the cab without Palmer and drove off. Palmer was never seen again. His suitcase was never recovered, nor was the taxi driver ever identified. \\n Developments \\n Howett and Arribas claimed that they fought with Palmer and left him lying on the ground of an industrial estate, still alive. In 2003, Hampshire police stated that they were treating Palmer\\'s disappearance as suspicious. Howett was arrested and his home was searched for clues, although he was never charged due to insufficient evidence. At the time, Howett was serving a 12-year sentence for drug smuggling. Another man was interviewed in Spain.  A 2009 inquest into Palmer\\'s disappearance resulted in an open verdict, since the coroner felt there was not enough evidence of unlawful killing, although he did also accuse Howett and Arribas of not telling the truth. Witnesses told conflicting stories of what happened afterwards - either Palmer died and his corpse was buried; or alternatively he recovered, went to Newcastle and was never seen again.  In 2014, police searched the garden of a pub in Fareham for evidence that Palmer was buried there, but found no clues.\"b\\' \\n Hildegardia migeodii \\n Range and habitat \\n It is occurs locally from southern Tanzania to southern Mozambique. It has been found up to 250 m, or locally to 700 m a.s.l., in forest fringes, woodland and wooded grassland.\\'b\\' \\n Meo di Siena \\n da Siena (active 1310-1333) was an Italian painter active in Umbria in a late-Gothic style. He is also known as Bartolomeo Guarnieri or Meo da Guido da Siena. He may be the son of a painter, Guido Guarnieri or Gratiani or Graziani of Siena, who settled in Perugia in 1319. He was influenced by Duccio, and is known for a few works in Umbria, including a polyptych of the Virgin and Saints in the Galleria Nazionale of Perugia. Attributed to Meo or his studio are also a tryptych in the Museum of the Duomo of Perugia and a polyptych originally in the church of San Pietro\\'b\\' \\n I.B. Tauris \\n History \\n I.B.Tauris was founded in 1983. Its declared strategy was to fill the perceived gap between trade publishing houses and university is, to publish serious but accessible works on international politics and culture. The company specialised in its early days on publishing on the Middle East. The publisher now specialises in non-fiction books on art, history (medieval and modern), politics and International Relations, the Middle East and Islamic world generally, religion, geography and environment, and visual culture (including film, photography and contemporary art). Its books are aimed primarily at the specialist market including academics and students. However, because of strong current interest in its preferred topics, the company also sells to a general audience. In the period following the September 11 attacks, for example, its publication Taliban by Ahmed Rashid is reported to have sold nearly 500,000 copies in English worldwide with 27 licensed editions internationally. Tauris Parke Paperbacks is a paperback imprint of the firm that concentrates on travel writing, popular history and biography. In May 2011, the company acquired the fine arts publisher Philip Wilson Publishers after handling its sales, marketing, and distribution for several years. In June 2013, the company announced an agreement with the American University in Cairo Press (AUCP) under which I.B. Tauris distributes all AUCP publications worldwide outside North America and Egypt. The two publishing houses also embarked on a series of international co-publications. This move was reportedly in line with an I.B.Tauris strategy to be the dominant player in international Middle East Studies publishing. In 2018, I.B. Tauris was acquired by Bloomsbury Publishing, where it continues as an imprint.\\'b\\' \\n Marcasite \\n Occurrence \\n Marcasite can be formed as both a primary or a secondary mineral. It typically forms under low-temperature highly acidic conditions. It occurs in sedimentary rocks (shales, limestones and low grade coals) as well as in low temperature hydrothermal veins. Commonly associated minerals include pyrite, pyrrhotite, galena, sphalerite, fluorite, dolomite and calcite. As a primary mineral it forms nodules, concretions and crystals in a variety of sedimentary rock, such as in the chalk layers found on both sides of the English Channel at Dover, Kent, England and at Cap Blanc Nez, Pas De Calais, France, where it forms as sharp individual crystals and crystal groups, and nodules (similar to those shown here).  As a secondary mineral it forms by chemical alteration of a primary mineral such as pyrrhotite or chalcopyrite. \\n Alteration \\n Marcasite reacts more readily than pyrite under conditions of high humidity. The product of this disintegration is iron(II) sulfate and sulfuric acid. The hydrous iron sulfate forms a white powder consisting of the mineral melanterite, This disintegration of marcasite in mineral collections is known as \"pyrite decay\". When a specimen goes through pyrite decay, the marcasite reacts with moisture and oxygen in the air, the sulfur oxidizing and combining with water to produce sulfuric acid that attacks other sulfide minerals and mineral labels. Low humidity (less than 60%) storage conditions prevents or slows the reaction.\\'b\\' \\n Wilson Carvalho \\n Non-league \\n Carvalho spent his youth at the centre of excellence at Stevenage after leaving Fulham\\\\\\'s Academy. He went on join the Nike Academy and was signed to Port Vale\\\\\\'s youth team after impressing on trial at Birmingham City. He never made a first-team appearance at Vale Park, though was loaned out to Southern League Premier Division side Hemel Hempstead Town for one month after the \"Tudors\" suffered an injury crisis in November 2013. On 6 December, he joined Hempstead\\\\\\'s divisional rivals Corby Town on a one month loan deal. On 10 January, he was loaned out to Northern Premier League Premier Division side Ilkeston and featured in three games for the \"Robins\" during a one month stay. He was released by \"Valiants\" manager Micky Adams in April 2014. He signed with Corby Town and scored 11 goals in 51 appearances across the campaign as Tommy Wright\\\\\\'s \"Steelmen\" won promotion as champions of the Southern League Premier Division. Corby also reached the final of the League Cup, but lost out to Poole Town on away goals. He had trials at Yeovil Town and Scottish Premiership club Heart of Midlothian in summer 2015. He had a successful trial at Braintree Town, but instead signed with Isthmian League Premier Division club Canvey Island on dual registration forms. He joined Kettering Town in November 2015. He was handed a six-game ban for spitting in a game against Bedworth United. He said that \"I have definitely learned a few lessons\" from the incident. He ended the campaign with 12 goals from 29 games and went on to add a further eight goals from 34 appearances in He signed with Oxford City on 9 February 2017, having previously played under manager Mark Jones in the youth-team at Stevenage. He featured 15 times for the \"Hoops\". On 20 March 2018, he rejoined former club Kettering Town. He played nine games for the \"Poppies\" in what remained of the season. On 6 August 2018, he was one of four players to sign a contract with Stratford Town of the Southern League Premier Division Central. A key player for Town, he scored 15 goals from 52 games in the season, helping the club to reach the play-offs and the League Cup final. They were beaten by King\\\\\\'s Lynn Town in the play-off semi-finals, but managed to beat Cinderford Town in the League Cup final. \\n Accrington Stanley \\n On 23 July 2019, he signed  a one-year deal with the option of a further year at League One side Accrington Stanley after impressing manager John Coleman on trial in pre-season friendlies. Assistant manager Jimmy Bell had previously coached him in Port Vale\\\\\\'s development squad. He scored his first goal for Stanley in a victory over Fleetwood Town in an EFL Trophy tie on 3 September. \\n Style of play \\n Carvalho is a pacey winger.\\' '"

In the following year, he ran as the party's candidate in the federal election in Cape Richmond, and won 7,750 votes. He placed third, but in Glace Bay, Akerman won three wards out of six. He decided to run in the Glace Bay provincial constituency in the next provincial election. Later in 1968, the NDP held a convention at Sydney, at which Akerman sought the party's provincial leadership. He was opposed by law professor Keith Jobson of Halifax, who was backed by outgoing leader James H. Aitchison, and won the contest by four votes becoming party leader at the age of 26. The next provincial election was held October 13, 1970. Akerman was elected in Glace Bay with a majority of 1,527 votes. Sydney school teacher Paul MacEwan was also elected, so the party held two seats in the Leg\n"
